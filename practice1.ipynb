A tillage point, or ripper point, is mounted on a forwardly projecting, generally wedge shaped mount at the bottom of the shank to fracture the soil as the implement advances.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">It has been found that conventional ripper points produce a soil profile with a mound of compact soil between the ripper points as illustrated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>. This mound of compact soil has a detrimental effect on root penetration into the soil. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved ripper point that produces a uniform and ideal subsurface soil profile by avoiding or minimizing the creation of mounds of compact soil between the ripper points.</p>\n",

Each of the embodiments <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> is discussed in more detail below, but it should be appreciated that the features common to each of the embodiments <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> results in a soil profile that avoids the undesirable mounding of compact soil between the ripper points that is typically produced with implements using conventional ripper points as illustrated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>\n",

This wider wingspan reduces the horizontal distance B between the wing tips of the adjacent wings. Additionally, in each of the embodiments <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> the vertical distance Y between the leading edge of the ripper point and the leading edge of the wings is preferably around 1 inch which is significantly shallower than the vertical distance X of the corresponding parts of conventional ripper points.</p>\n",

The surface treatment <b>500</b> may also be applied to the leading edges <b>125</b>, <b>225</b>, <b>325</b>, <b>425</b>, the trailing edges <b>126</b>, <b>226</b>, <b>326</b>, <b>426</b> of the wings <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>420</b>. Surface treatment may also be applied to other areas of ripper point such as near the rearward end <b>118</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>318</b>, <b>418</b> or to the bottom side of the wings or at the base of the wings where they meet the main body <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>. The placement of surface treatment on the rearward end <b>118</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>318</b>, <b>418</b> of the main body <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>, not only reduced wear but also turbulates the flow of soil ahead of the shank <b>20</b>. Testing has shown that the rearward end <b>118</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>318</b>, <b>418</b> and the shank <b>20</b> are high wear areas. If surface treatment is applied to greater thickness (e.g., greater than the &#x215b; inch thickness on the wing surface as identified above), the soil flow is disrupted, thereby prolonging the life of the shank <b>20</b>. In an alternative embodiment as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 46</figref>, a fin <b>460</b> may be attached to the main body <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>410</b> to also disrupt the soil flow ahead of the shank, thereby prolonging the life of the shank <b>20</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0071\">It should be appreciated that although construction varies between the three embodiments <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> each of the three embodiments have substantially the same overall configuration and geometry as described in connection with embodiment <b>100</b>. Thus, when the ripper points <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> are mounted to the shanks <b>20</b> of the tillage implement, due to the wider wingspan in comparison to conventional ripper points, the horizontal distance B (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>) between the wing tips <b>127</b>, <b>227</b>, <b>327</b>, <b>427</b> of the adjacent wings is significantly less than the distance A (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>) of conventional ripper points. Additionally, in each of the embodiments <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> the vertical distance Y (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>) between the leading edges <b>116</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>316</b>, <b>416</b> of the main bodies <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>410</b> of the ripper points <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> and the respective leading edges <b>125</b>, <b>225</b>, <b>325</b>, <b>425</b> of the wings <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>420</b> is preferably around 1 inch which is significantly shallower than the vertical distance X (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>) of the corresponding parts of conventional ripper points.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0072\">Additionally, in order to reduce drag on the ripper points as they are pulled through the soil, in each of the embodiments <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> the leading edge <b>125</b>, <b>225</b>, <b>325</b>, <b>425</b> of the wings is sloped downwardly and forwardly from the trailing edges <b>126</b>, <b>226</b>, <b>326</b>, <b>426</b> of the respective wing members <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>420</b>. Such configuration has been shown to produce a soil profile with little or no undesirable mounds of compact soil being formed between the wingtips <b>127</b>, <b>227</b>, <b>327</b>, <b>427</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0073\">The ripper points <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> are configured to reduce drag on the leading edges of the wings while still having an optimal working width between wing tips <b>127</b>. Wings <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>420</b> engage the soil at a shallower depth than the leading edge of the nose <b>116</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>316</b>, <b>416</b> while being forwardly positioned along main body <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>410</b> such that the leading and trailing wings edges <b>125</b>/<b>126</b>, <b>225</b>/<b>226</b>, <b>325</b>/<b>326</b>, <b>425</b>/<b>426</b> minimize peaks and valleys in the soil profile. In such a configuration, the leading edges <b>125</b>, <b>225</b>, <b>325</b>, <b>425</b> engage and fracture harder compacted soil (i.e., hardpan), while the wings <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>420</b> lift and twist looser soil, thereby burying residue and adding oxygen to the soil. The wing sections <b>123</b>/<b>124</b>, <b>223</b>/<b>224</b>, <b>323</b>/<b>324</b>, <b>423</b>/<b>424</b> are angled downwardly with respect to the main body <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>410</b> about an axis perpendicular to the direction of travel. This configuration enables each wing <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>420</b> to produce a greater degree of soil fracture, thereby increasing soil oxygen content and enhancing root growth. Additionally, the leading edges <b>125</b>, <b>225</b>, <b>325</b>, <b>425</b> of each wing is configured to engage the soil at a greater depth than the trailing edges <b>126</b>, <b>226</b>, <b>326</b>, <b>426</b> of the wing which is believed to substantially reduce or eliminate soil compaction under the wings <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>426</b>.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">The preparation of agricultural fields for planting crops can involve conditioning the soil to optimize soil density and nutrients for plant growth. The soil conditioning process often involves the use of a tractor-towed implement configured with ground penetrating tools that break up and aerate the soil and inject fertilizer into the soil. Examples of such implements include cultivators, tillers, rippers, chisel plows, anhydrous knife fertilizers, and manure injectors, in which a plurality of one or more tools, such as discs and/or shanks are mounted on a tool bar of the implement. The shanks of such implements are designed to penetrate into the soil, which exposes them to underground obstacles. To minimize damage from such obstacles, shanks are typically pivotally mounted to the implement with a pivot bolt, and secured from pivoting by a shear bolt that is spaced from the pivot bolt. If an obstacle of considerable size is encountered, the shear bolt minimizes the risk of damage to the shank by shearing thereby allowing the shank to pivot up and away from the obstacle. Over time, shear pins can become fatigued and eventually fail due to the soil conditions encountered by the shank. An operator may not and often does not detect a broken shear pin until well after the event that caused the pin to shear, which results in potentially a significant area of soil that has not been conditioned. This can have considerable impact on crop yields, due to poor soil preparation and/or fertilizing, or can have a considerable impact on fuel costs to re-work the portions of the field where the shank was inoperative. A system for detecting and notifying an operator that a shank has pivoted away from its ground penetrating position would be beneficial.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">In the following Detailed Description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In this regard, directional terminology, such as &#x201c;top,&#x201d; &#x201c;bottom,&#x201d; &#x201c;front,&#x201d; &#x201c;back,&#x201d; &#x201c;leading,&#x201d; &#x201c;trailing,&#x201d; etc., is used with reference to the orientation of the Figure(s) being described. Because components of embodiments of the invention can be positioned in a number of different orientations, the directional terminology is used for purposes of illustration and is in no way limiting. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate respective side and end views of an agricultural tool <b>10</b> with a monitoring system <b>30</b> in accordance with one embodiment. In one embodiment, agricultural tool <b>10</b> is a tractor-towed implement configured with ground penetrating tools that break up and aerate the soil and inject fertilizer into the soil. Such systems include tillage, or fertilizer (manure or commercial or anhydrous) systems, such as a cultivator, tiller, ripper, chisel plow, anhydrous knife fertilizer, strip till, or manure injector. Examples of such equipment include, but are not limited to, Wilrich soil pro 513, Wilrich 2530, Landluvr strip till attachments, Yetter strip till attachment, Kuhn 4830, Kuhn Dominator 4855, Great Plains Ripper, Case 5300 Strip rig, Bingham, Dietrich series 70 auto reset, and slurry injectors.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\">In one embodiment, agricultural tool <b>10</b> includes a first plate <b>11</b> and second plate <b>14</b> (not visible in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>; illustrated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>) that are part of, or coupled to, a tool bar of the implement to be towed by a tractor or the like. Typically, the plates will be coupled to a tool bar in conjunction with springs that provide some shock absorption for the agricultural tool <b>10</b> so that it can flex as there is impact with objects on the ground <b>20</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0014\" num=\"0013\">Agricultural tool <b>10</b> further includes a shank <b>12</b>, which is coupled to first and second plates <b>11</b> and <b>14</b>, and is configured for penetration into the ground <b>20</b> to be tilled. Shank <b>12</b> is pivotably coupled to first and second plates <b>11</b>/<b>14</b> via pivot bolt <b>18</b>. Shank <b>12</b> is prevented from pivoting relative to plates <b>11</b>/<b>14</b>, however, when shear bolt <b>16</b> is installed extending through each of plates <b>11</b>/<b>14</b> and through shank <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, agricultural tool <b>10</b> may include several such shanks that are spaced from one another on a tool bar that can extend the width of a tractor or greater.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0015\" num=\"0014\">Agricultural tool <b>10</b> further includes monitoring system <b>30</b> in accordance with one embodiment. In one embodiment, monitoring system <b>30</b> includes plate mounting bracket <b>32</b>, sensor <b>34</b>, shank bracket <b>36</b> and sensor target <b>38</b>. In one embodiment, plate mounting bracket <b>32</b> is coupled to first plate <b>11</b>, such as via pivot bolt <b>18</b>, or by other bolts, or by welding or similar means. Sensor <b>34</b> is fixed to plate mounting bracket <b>32</b> such that it is configured in close proximity to shank <b>12</b>, shank bracket <b>36</b> and sensor target <b>38</b>. In one embodiment, bracket <b>36</b> is fixed to a top surface of shank <b>12</b> and sensor target <b>38</b> is couple to bracket <b>36</b> such that it is held in close proximity to sensor <b>34</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0016\" num=\"0015\">In one embodiment, sensor target <b>38</b> is in communication with an alarm <b>40</b> that can be locate near the operator of the tractor or vehicle that is pulling agricultural tool <b>10</b>. For example, sensor target <b>38</b> can be hard wired to an alarm <b>40</b> that is in a tractor cab. Alternatively, sensor target <b>38</b> can be wirelessly coupled to such an alarm <b>40</b>, such as by RF communication. In one embodiment, sensor <b>34</b> is a proximity sensor and sensor target <b>38</b> is a magnet. As long as sensor target <b>38</b> is in close proximity to sensor <b>34</b>, a signal will be sent to the alarm <b>40</b> that is indicative of shank <b>12</b> being properly oriented to penetrate the ground <b>20</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0017\" num=\"0016\">In operation, agricultural tool <b>10</b> is pulled, by a tractor or the like, in direction <b>22</b> over ground <b>20</b>. Shank <b>12</b>, illustrated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> below the surface, penetrates and rips into ground <b>20</b> and agitates the soil. Shank <b>12</b> is held in this ripping position at least in part by shear bolt <b>16</b>. <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates, in phantom lines, how shear bolt <b>16</b> extends through first plate <b>11</b> via hole <b>16</b><i>a, </i>through shank <b>12</b> via hole <b>16</b><i>b </i>and through second plate <b>14</b> via hole <b>16</b><i>c. </i>In some instances, when shank <b>12</b> encounters an obstacle in ground <b>20</b>, such as a stump, rock or other impediment or obstacle, the springs provided on agricultural tool <b>10</b> allow shank <b>12</b> to move away from the obstacle and continue tilling. In other instances, however, the force of the impact of the obstacle on the shank <b>12</b> may be too much for the springs to absorb, and the force may cause shank <b>12</b> to shear off or break shear bolt <b>16</b>, thereby allowing shank <b>12</b> to pivot up away from the obstacle and ground <b>20</b> by pivoting about pivot bolt <b>18</b>. While this may prevent damage to shank <b>12</b> by the obstacle, it also prevents the shank <b>12</b> from properly agitating the soil as agricultural tool <b>10</b> continues along.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0018\" num=\"0017\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> illustrate respective side and end views of an agricultural tool <b>10</b> with a monitoring system <b>30</b>, in accordance with one embodiment, when shank <b>12</b> has pivoted into the illustrated pivoted position, such as when it has encountered an obstacle. In such case, shear bolt <b>16</b> has been sheared away leaving holes <b>16</b><i>a/b/c </i>open allowing shank to pivot about pivot bolt <b>18</b>, which is illustrates in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref> in phantom lines passing through holes <b>18</b><i>a/b/c </i>of first plate <b>11</b>, shank <b>12</b> and second plate <b>14</b>, respectively.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0019\" num=\"0018\">As also illustrated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, as shank <b>12</b> pivots away from the ground <b>20</b> and obstacle, sensor target <b>38</b>, which is coupled to shank <b>12</b>, also moves away from sensor <b>34</b>, which remains fixed to first plate <b>11</b>. In this case, sensor <b>34</b> sends a signal to the alarm <b>40</b> that indicates the shank <b>12</b> has been rotated into the pivoted position, thereby notifying the operator that shank <b>12</b> is no longer in ripping position. In one embodiment, alarm <b>40</b> is a visual signal to alert an operator that a shank <b>12</b> has rotated away from the ground into the pivoted position; in another embodiment, an audio signal is sent; in another embodiment, a vibration is activated, and in other embodiments, various combinations of these warnings are activated in alarm <b>40</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0020\" num=\"0019\">In one embodiment, sensor <b>34</b> and sensor target <b>38</b> are located toward the back of agricultural tool <b>10</b>, relative to the direction of tow <b>22</b>. To generate a notification signal to alarm <b>40</b> that there has been a change of position and shank <b>12</b> is no longer in ripping position, sensor target <b>38</b> must rotate away from sensor <b>34</b>. In order for the two to sufficiently separate, sensor <b>34</b> and sensor target <b>38</b> should be located far enough away from pivot bolt <b>18</b> such that the upward pivot of shank <b>12</b>, on which sensor target <b>38</b> is mounted, moves sensor target <b>38</b> far enough away from sensor <b>34</b> to generate the position-change signal. If sensor <b>34</b> and sensor target <b>38</b> are mounted directly above pivot bolt <b>18</b>, it is possible the sensor <b>34</b> and sensor target <b>38</b> will remain too close together, even when shank <b>12</b> has pivoted out of the ground <b>20</b>, such that no signal will be generated to notify the operator of the position change. In one embodiment, sensor <b>34</b> and sensor target <b>38</b> are located closer to shear bolt <b>16</b> than to pivot bolt <b>16</b> in order to ensure adequate relative movement of sensor <b>34</b> and sensor target <b>38</b>. In another embodiment, sensor <b>34</b> and sensor target <b>38</b> are located essentially above shear bolt <b>16</b> in order to ensure that a signal will be sent to alarm <b>40</b> whenever shank <b>12</b> pivots upward.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0021\" num=\"0020\">In one embodiment, sensor <b>34</b> is coupled to either first or second plate <b>11</b>/<b>14</b>, while sensor target <b>38</b> is coupled to shank <b>12</b>. Because neither first nor second plate <b>11</b>/<b>14</b> rotate upon the shearing of shear pin <b>16</b>, it may be useful in some embodiments, such as where sensor <b>34</b> is hard-wired to alarm <b>40</b>, to have sensor <b>34</b> coupled to either first or second plate <b>11</b>/<b>14</b>. In this way, there are no moving parts that would risk damage to the wired connection between sensor <b>34</b> and alarm <b>40</b>. In one embodiment, such as when sensor target <b>38</b> is a magnet, even though it does rotate with shank <b>12</b>, sensor target <b>38</b> is not coupled back to, or in direct communication with, the alarm <b>40</b>. As such, even though sensor target <b>38</b> is coupled to the moving shank <b>12</b>, it is less likely that the harsh environment, significant impact and vibration to which shank <b>12</b> is subjected will cause disruption to the proper operation of alarm <b>40</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0022\" num=\"0021\">In one embodiment, sensor <b>34</b> is a Hall-effect sensor, which is a transducer that varies its output voltage in response to a magnetic field, such as that of a magnet target <b>38</b>. Such Hall-effect sensors have been proven to be quite reliable in the harsh conditions to which agricultural tool <b>10</b> is subjected. In other embodiments, various other devices can be used for sensor <b>34</b> and sensor target <b>38</b>. For example, optical sensor devices can be used. In one embodiment, sensor <b>34</b> can be an optical sensor and sensor target <b>38</b> can be a light source. In another embodiment, sensor <b>34</b> can be a whisker switch and sensor target <b>38</b> may not be needed, and the whisker switch can instead directly impact against shank <b>12</b>, such that pivoting of shank <b>12</b> trips the whisker switch. Also, in some embodiments, sensor <b>34</b> and sensor target can be located differently, such that sensor <b>34</b> is mounted in shank <b>12</b> and sensor target <b>38</b> on first plate <b>11</b>, or such that sensor <b>34</b> is mounted in second plate <b>14</b> and sensor target <b>38</b> on shank <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, especially given the harsh environment in which agricultural tool <b>10</b> typically operates, it may be advantageous to have redundant sensors <b>34</b> mounted on each of first and second plates <b>11</b> and <b>14</b> with sensor target <b>38</b> mounted in shank <b>12</b>. In this way, even where one of the redundant sensors fails, the non-failing sensor can signal alarm <b>40</b> of shank <b>12</b> position changes.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0023\" num=\"0022\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a side view of an agricultural tool <b>50</b> with a monitoring system <b>70</b> in accordance with one embodiment. In one embodiment, agricultural tool <b>50</b> is similar to tool <b>10</b> above, and is a tractor-towed implement configured with ground penetrating tools. In one embodiment, agricultural tool <b>50</b> includes a first plate <b>51</b> and second plate <b>54</b> (not visible in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>) that are part of, or coupled to, a tool bar of the implement to be towed by a tractor or the like. Agricultural tool <b>50</b> further includes a shank <b>52</b>, which is coupled to first and second plates <b>51</b> and <b>54</b>, and is configured for penetration into the ground <b>60</b> to be tilled. Shank <b>52</b> is pivotably coupled to first and second plates <b>51</b>/<b>54</b> via pivot bolt <b>58</b>. Shank <b>52</b> is prevented from pivoting relative to plates <b>51</b>/<b>54</b>, however, when shear bolt <b>56</b> (which has been sheared away in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>) is installed extending through each of plates <b>51</b>/<b>54</b> and through shank <b>52</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0024\" num=\"0023\">In <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, shank <b>52</b> is illustrated in the pivoted position, such that shearing bolt <b>56</b> has been sheared away, leaving holes <b>56</b><i>a </i>in first plate <b>51</b> and <b>56</b><i>b </i>in shank <b>52</b> each open, and shank <b>52</b> is pivoted out of the ground <b>60</b>. In one embodiment, while agricultural tool <b>50</b> is towed in direction <b>62</b> and shank <b>52</b> encountered an obstacle, shank <b>52</b> shears shear pin <b>56</b> and pivots up.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0025\" num=\"0024\">Similar to tool <b>10</b> above, agricultural tool <b>50</b> also includes a monitoring system <b>70</b> in accordance with one embodiment. In one embodiment, monitoring system <b>70</b> includes sensor <b>74</b>, sensor target <b>78</b> and alarm <b>80</b>. In one embodiment, plate mounting bracket <b>72</b> is coupled to first plate <b>51</b>, such as via pivot bolt <b>58</b>, or by other welding, bolts or similar means. Sensor <b>74</b> is fixed to plate mounting bracket <b>72</b> such that it is configured in close proximity to shank <b>52</b> and sensor target <b>78</b>, when shank <b>52</b> is in the ripping position. In one embodiment, sensor target <b>78</b> is welded directly to shank <b>52</b>. In another embodiment, sensor target <b>78</b> is embedded into shank <b>52</b>, such as firmly mounted in a hole within shank <b>52</b>. The location of sensor target <b>78</b> on or within shank <b>52</b> is configured to align with sensor <b>74</b> when shank <b>52</b> is generally aligned with first and second plates <b>51</b>/<b>54</b> and is penetrating the ground <b>60</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0026\" num=\"0025\">In operation of agricultural tool <b>50</b>, as shank <b>52</b> pivots away from the ground <b>60</b> and an encountered obstacle, sensor target <b>78</b>, which is coupled to shank <b>52</b>, also moves away from sensor <b>74</b>, which remains fixed to the end of first plate <b>51</b>. In this case, sensor <b>74</b> sends a signal to the alarm <b>80</b> that indicates the shank <b>52</b> has been rotated into the pivoted position, thereby notifying the operator that shank <b>52</b> is no longer in ripping position. In one embodiment, alarm <b>80</b> is a visual signal to alert an operator that a shank <b>52</b> has rotated away from the ground into the pivoted position; in another embodiment, an audio signal is sent; in another embodiment, a vibration is activated, and in other embodiments, various combinations of these warnings are activated in alarm <b>80</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0027\" num=\"0026\">In one embodiment, sensor <b>74</b> is located on a lower edge of first plate <b>51</b>. As agricultural tool <b>50</b> is towed in direction <b>62</b>, shank <b>52</b> and various other agitating mechanisms attached to agricultural tool <b>50</b> cause significant dirt, mud, snow and various other debris to impact tool <b>50</b>. Accordingly, locating sensor <b>74</b> on a lower edge surface, relative to the direction of tow <b>62</b>, helps mitigate the impact such debris will have on sensor <b>74</b>, at least partially shielding sensor <b>74</b> by plate <b>51</b>. A similar protection can be afforded using a back surface of second plate <b>52</b> or other surface that is opposite to the direction of travel <b>62</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0028\" num=\"0027\">As discussed, agricultural tool <b>10</b> may include several shanks <b>12</b>/<b>52</b> that are spaced from one another on a tool bar that can extend the width of a tractor or greater. In one embodiment, a monitoring system <b>30</b>/<b>70</b> is provided for each shank <b>12</b>/<b>52</b>. For example, if agricultural tool <b>10</b> has 24 shanks <b>12</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>12</b><sub>24</sub>, each shank <b>12</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>12</b><sub>24 </sub>includes a respective monitoring system <b>30</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>30</b><sub>24</sub>. In addition, each such monitoring system <b>30</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>30</b><sub>24 </sub>is individually coupled to alarm <b>40</b>/<b>80</b>. In this way, alarm <b>40</b>/<b>80</b> not only identifies when a shank <b>12</b> has broken, but also identified which of the 24, in one example, has broken.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0029\" num=\"0028\">In one embodiment, agricultural tool <b>10</b> further includes protective sleeve <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>. Because of the harsh environment in which agricultural tool <b>10</b> typically operates and because of the impact to which certain portions of tool <b>10</b> are subjected, protective sleeve <b>100</b> provides protection to wiring that is coupled between monitoring system <b>30</b>/<b>70</b> and alarm <b>40</b>/<b>80</b>. Sleeve <b>100</b> can protect the wiring from being severed thereby ensuring the continued operation of monitoring system <b>30</b>/<b>70</b> and alarm <b>40</b>/<b>80</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0030\" num=\"0029\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates protective sleeve <b>100</b> assembled on agricultural tool <b>10</b> in accordance with one embodiment. As previously described, in one embodiment shank <b>12</b> is coupled to first and second plates <b>11</b> and <b>14</b>. Furthermore, in one embodiment first and second plates <b>11</b> and <b>14</b> are coupled to a frame <b>110</b> of agricultural tool <b>10</b>. Frame <b>110</b> is part of, or coupled to, a tool bar of the implement to be towed by a tractor or the like. Frame <b>110</b> is also configured to flex upward as shank <b>12</b> and other portions tool <b>10</b> impact the ground <b>20</b>. In some instances, certain portions of frame <b>110</b> will impact against other parts of agricultural tool <b>10</b> as it moves. In such instances, wires <b>45</b>, which are coupled between monitoring system <b>30</b> and alarm <b>40</b>, are readily severed, thereby disabling the system.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0031\" num=\"0030\">Accordingly, protective sleeve <b>100</b> is assembled on agricultural tool <b>10</b>, particularly on portions thereof that are likely to be subjected to impact with other parts of agricultural tool <b>10</b>. Wiring <b>45</b> can then be fed between protective sleeve <b>100</b> and frame <b>110</b>. In this way, when frame <b>110</b> impacts against other parts of agricultural tool <b>10</b> as it moves, such impact will be against protective sleeve <b>100</b>, and wiring <b>45</b> is protected underneath. As such, monitoring system <b>30</b> and alarm <b>40</b> remain in communication and the system remains operational.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0032\" num=\"0031\">In some embodiments, the portion of frame <b>110</b> that is likely to be subjected to impact is substantially rectangular in shape. As such, in one embodiment protective sleeve <b>100</b> is substantially c-shaped such that it can be readily slid over the top of frame <b>110</b> without any required modification to frame <b>110</b>. Then, securing bolts <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> can be slid through slots provided at the lower edge of the c-shaped protective sleeve <b>100</b>, thereby securing it in place. Such a configuration is convenient in some embodiments, because it readily protects wiring <b>45</b> from damage, but does not require any modification to frame <b>110</b>. It can be easily added to a variety of existing agricultural tools <b>10</b>.</p>\n",

The method also includes, prior to removing the tissue sample from each of the individual seeds, adjusting at least one operational parameter of the seed sampling system based on the at least one characteristic of the seed from which the tissue is to be removed to thereby allow for generally consistent removal of tissue from each of the individual seeds. In some aspects, the method further includes analyzing the tissue removed from the seeds for presence or absence of at least one characteristic, and selecting seeds based on presence or absence of the at least one characteristic.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate an automated seed sampling system <b>10</b>, in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure. The seed sorter system <b>10</b> includes a seed loading station <b>100</b>, a seed transport subsystem <b>200</b>, a seed imagining station <b>300</b>, a seed orientation station <b>400</b>, a seed sampling and sort station <b>500</b> and a central controller system (CCS) <b>700</b> that controls the operation of the seed sorter system <b>10</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0044\">Generally, the seed sampling system <b>10</b> is structured and operable to repetitiously separate a select number of seeds, e.g., sets of eight seeds at a time, from a bulk of seeds within a bulk seed hopper <b>104</b> (e.g., <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3A</figref>, etc.) at the seed loading station <b>100</b>. Additionally, the seed sampling system <b>10</b> is structured and operable to image each set of seeds at the imaging station <b>300</b>. The images collected at the imaging station <b>300</b> can be any desirable type of images. For example, the images can be visual images, near infra-red (NIR) images or NMR/MRI images, or any other type images. In various embodiments, the imaging station <b>300</b> collects at least one digital image of each set of seeds. The image data collected of each set of seeds is communicated to a CCS <b>700</b> where the image data is analyzed to determine the orientation, e.g., &#x2018;tip out&#x2019; or &#x2018;crown out&#x2019;. The seed sampling system <b>10</b> is further structured and operable to orient each set of seeds in a desired orientation, based on the images of each respective set of seeds, at the orientation station <b>400</b>. The seed sampling system <b>10</b> is still further structured and operable to extract a sample (e.g., a tissue sample, etc.) from a selected area, e.g., the crown, of each seed in each set of seeds. Further yet, the seed sampling system <b>10</b> is structured and operable to then collect the extracted samples in a plurality of sample trays <b>14</b> and sort the respective sampled seeds into a plurality of seed trays <b>18</b> at the seed sample and sort station <b>500</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0045\">Once a set of seeds is separated from the bulk of seeds at the seed loading stations, as described below, the seeds are loaded onto one of a plurality of rotary vacuum cup (RVC) banks <b>204</b>. The respective set of seeds is then sequentially positioned adjacent each of the imaging station <b>300</b>, the orientation station <b>400</b> and the sample and sort station <b>500</b>, via the seed transport subsystem <b>200</b>. More specifically, the seed transport subsystem <b>200</b> includes an automated transport carousel <b>208</b> to which the plurality of the RVC banks <b>204</b> are mounted. The automated transport carousel <b>208</b> (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4A</figref>) is driven by a motor (not shown), e.g., a stepper motor, that incrementally rotates the transport carousel <b>208</b> to sequentially advance each RVC bank <b>204</b> to each of the stations <b>100</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> and <b>500</b>. Therefore, each set of seeds is retained by a respective RVC bank <b>204</b> and transported to positions adjacent each of the imaging station <b>300</b>, the orientation station <b>400</b> and the sample and sort station <b>500</b> by the incremental rotation of the transport carousel <b>208</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0046\">The operation of the seed sorter system <b>10</b> is generally completely controlled and automated by the CCS <b>700</b> such that the operations performed by the imaging station <b>300</b>, the orientation station <b>400</b> and the sample and sort station <b>500</b> occur substantially without need for human interaction, intervention or control. However, such actions as loading the seeds into the bulk seed hopper <b>104</b> and/or physically manipulating and/or changing the sample trays <b>14</b> and seed trays <b>18</b> (either individually or collectively) can be performed manually with human participation.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\">Generally, the CCS <b>700</b> includes one or more processors and/or microprocessors, and one or more electronic data storage devices utilized to store and execute various custom programs, applications and/or algorithms to effectuate the operation of the seed sorter system <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the CCS <b>700</b> can comprise a specially programmed computer, or computer system, in communication with associated system devices (not shown) that enable communication with and control over the operations of the various stations <b>100</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> and <b>500</b> and the transport subsystem <b>200</b> of the seed sorter system <b>10</b>. Although the CCS <b>700</b> is exemplarily illustrated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> as a single unit, the CCS <b>700</b> can be a single computer based system or a plurality of computer based subsystems networked together to coordinate the simultaneous operations of the seed sorter system <b>10</b>, as described herein. For example, in various embodiments, the CCS <b>700</b> can include a main controller subsystem networked together with a plurality of peripheral controller subsystems (not shown), e.g., a peripheral controller subsystem for each station <b>100</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>, <b>500</b> and transport subsystem <b>200</b>. Each peripheral controller subsystem can include one or more processors, microprocessors and electronic data storage devices that effectuate communication with various seed sorter system components, e.g., sensors, devices, mechanisms, motors, tools, etc., and together with the main controller subsystem cooperatively operate all the stations, systems and subsystems of the seed sampler system <b>10</b>. Or alternatively, the CCS <b>700</b> can comprise a single computer communicatively connected to all the various system components to cooperatively operate all the stations, systems and subsystems of the seed sampler system <b>10</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\">As described above, the CCS <b>700</b> communicates with various seed sorter system components that include various system sensors. The system sensors operate to detect conditions of interest during operation of the seed sorter system <b>10</b> and communicate that information to the CCS <b>700</b>. With this information, the CCS <b>700</b> generates control commands that effectuate the operations and actions taken by the various stations and components of the seed sorter system <b>10</b>. For example, a sensed condition can concern: the successful isolation of sets of seeds from the seed hopper <b>104</b>; the successful retention, or loading, of the each of the seeds by a respective RVC bank <b>204</b>; the proper positioning of each loaded bank of seeds adjacent each respective station <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> and <b>500</b>; the status (for example, position, location, vacuum, pressure, and the like) of various component parts of the various stations <b>100</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> and <b>500</b>; operation, maintenance, performance, and error feedback from the various components of each station <b>100</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> and <b>500</b> (separate from, or perhaps comprising or in conjunction with, collected data); and the like. More specifically, sensor information that is collected and processed for use in controlling operation of the seed sorter system <b>10</b> can include such information as: device or component status; error signals; movement; stall; position; location; temperature; voltage; current; pressure; and the like, which can be monitored with respect to the operation of each of the stations, subsystems and associated components of the seed sorter system <b>10</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0049\">It should be understood that the seed sorter system <b>10</b>, as shown and described herein, includes various stationary braces, beams, platforms, pedestals, stands, etc., to which various components, devices, mechanisms, systems, subsystems, assemblies and sub-assemblies described herein are coupled, connected and/or mounted. Although such braces, beams, platforms, pedestals, stands, etc., are necessary to the construction of the seed sampler system <b>10</b>, description of their placement, orientation and interconnections are not necessary for one skilled in the art to easily and fully comprehend the structure, function and operation of the seed sampler system <b>10</b>. Particularly, such braces, beams, platforms, pedestals, stands, etc., are clearly illustrated throughout the figures and, as such, their placement, orientation and interconnections are easily understood by one skilled in the art. Therefore, for simplicity, such braces, beams, platforms, pedestals, stands, etc. will be referred to herein merely as system support structures, absent further description of their placement, orientation and interconnections.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0050\">Referring now to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 3A, 3B and 3C</figref> in various embodiments, the seed loading station <b>100</b> includes the seed hopper <b>104</b> and a separating wheel <b>108</b>. The separating wheel <b>108</b> is mounted for rotation in a vertical plane such that a portion of the separating wheel <b>108</b> extends into an interior reservoir of the seed hopper <b>104</b>. Another portion of the separating wheel <b>108</b> extends outside of the seed hopper <b>104</b> such that a face <b>110</b> of the separating wheel <b>108</b> is positioned adjacent a seed collector <b>114</b>. The seed separating wheel <b>108</b> includes a plurality of spaced apart recessed ports <b>118</b> that extend through the face <b>110</b> and are communicatively coupled to a vacuum system (not shown) such that a vacuum can be provided at each of the recessed ports <b>118</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0052\" num=\"0051\">To initiate operation of the seed sampler system <b>10</b>, seeds to be sampled and tested are placed in the seed hopper <b>104</b> interior reservoir and a vacuum is provided to at least some of the recessed ports <b>118</b>, e.g., the recessed ports <b>118</b> in the face <b>110</b> of the portion of the separating wheel <b>108</b> extending into the interior reservoir of the seed hopper <b>104</b>. The seed separating wheel <b>108</b> is then incrementally rotated, via an indexing motor <b>122</b>, such that recessed ports <b>118</b> sequentially rotate through the interior reservoir of the seed hopper <b>104</b>, out of the seed hopper <b>104</b>, and past seed collector <b>114</b> before re-entering the interior reservoir of the seed hopper <b>104</b>. As the separating wheel incrementally rotates and the recessed ports <b>118</b> incrementally pass through the seed hopper <b>104</b> interior reservoir, individual seeds are picked up and held at each recessed port <b>118</b> by the vacuum provided at the respective recessed ports <b>118</b>. As the separating wheel <b>108</b> incrementally rotates, the seeds are carried out of the seed hopper <b>104</b> to the seed collector <b>114</b> where each seed is removed from the face <b>110</b> of the separating wheel <b>108</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0053\" num=\"0052\">In various embodiments, the seed collector <b>114</b> includes a wiper (not shown) that physically dislodges each seed from the respective recessed port <b>118</b> as the separating wheel <b>108</b> incrementally rotates past the seed collector <b>114</b>. Alternatively, in various other embodiments, each seed can be released from respective recessed port <b>118</b> by temporarily terminating the vacuum at each individual recessed port <b>118</b> as the individual recessed port <b>118</b> is positioned adjacent the seed collector <b>114</b>. In still other embodiments, each seed can be blown from the respective recessed port <b>118</b> by temporarily providing forced air at each individual recessed port <b>118</b> as the individual recessed port <b>118</b> is positioned adjacent the seed collector <b>114</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0054\" num=\"0053\">After each seed is removed from the separating wheel <b>108</b>, the seed is funneled into one of a plurality of first transfer tubes <b>126</b> having their proximal ends connected to openings <b>128</b> in a tube shuttle <b>130</b>. The tube shuttle <b>130</b> is mounted to a carriage <b>134</b> that is movably mounted to a linear translation stage <b>138</b> that includes an actuator <b>142</b> controllable by the CCS <b>700</b> to bi-directionally move the carriage <b>134</b>, tube shuttle <b>130</b> and proximal ends of the first transfer tubes <b>126</b> along the translation stage <b>138</b>. Therefore, as each seed is removed from the separating wheel <b>108</b>, the seed is funneled into one of the first transfer tubes <b>126</b>. Then the CCS <b>700</b> moves the tube shuttle <b>130</b> along the translation stage such that a subsequent first transfer tube <b>126</b> will receive the next seed removed from the separating wheel <b>108</b>. This process of removing seeds is repeated until a seed has been deposited into each of the first transfer tubes <b>126</b>. As each seed is removed from the separating wheel <b>108</b> and deposited into a first transfer tube <b>126</b>, each seed passes through the respective first transfer tuber <b>126</b>, via gravity, vacuum or forced air, to a queuing stack <b>150</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0055\" num=\"0054\">As shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3B</figref>, the queuing stack <b>150</b> includes a plurality of upper chambers <b>154</b>, e.g., eight upper chambers <b>154</b>. A distal end of each first transfer tube <b>126</b> terminates at a corresponding one of the upper chambers <b>154</b>. Each upper chamber <b>154</b> includes an automated upper release mechanism <b>156</b>, e.g., a flapper gate, that, under control of the CCS <b>700</b>, retains the respective seed within the upper chamber <b>154</b>. Once each upper chamber has a seed deposited therein, the upper release mechanisms <b>156</b> are commanded to release the seeds into a plurality, e.g., eight, of corresponding lower chambers <b>158</b>. Similar to the upper chambers <b>154</b>, each lower chamber <b>158</b> includes an automated lower release mechanism <b>160</b>, e.g., a flapper gate, that, under control of the CCS <b>700</b>, retains the respective seed within the lower chamber <b>154</b>. The lower chambers <b>158</b> retain the seeds until such time as the CCS <b>700</b> commands the lower release mechanisms <b>160</b> to release the seeds into a plurality of corresponding second transfer tubes <b>162</b> having their proximal ends connected to the lower chambers <b>158</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0056\" num=\"0055\">As shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3C</figref>, a distal end of each second transfer tube <b>162</b> terminates at a corresponding one a plurality of elevator chambers <b>164</b>, e.g., eight, of an elevator hopper <b>166</b>. Thus, as the seeds are released from the lower chambers <b>158</b> into the second transfer tubes <b>162</b>, each seed passes through the respective second transfer tube <b>162</b>, via gravity, vacuum or forced air, into a corresponding one of the elevator chambers <b>164</b>. Once a seed is deposed into each elevator chamber <b>164</b>, the group of seeds therein constitutes a set of seeds, as used herein. The elevator hopper <b>166</b> additionally includes a plurality of elevator piston rods <b>170</b>. Each elevator piston rod <b>170</b> is positioned within, and extendable through, an aperture <b>174</b> formed in a funnel-shaped bottom <b>178</b> of a corresponding elevator chamber <b>164</b>. In various embodiments, a distal end of each elevator piston rod <b>170</b> is formed to have a concave recess <b>180</b> shaped to cradle the seeds received from the lower chambers <b>158</b> of the queuing stack <b>150</b>. Additionally, the angled sides of the funnel-shaped bottom <b>178</b> allows for the seeds entering the respective elevator chambers <b>164</b> to fall onto their sides, i.e., lay flat, and be centered within the recess <b>180</b> of the respective elevator piston rods <b>170</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0057\" num=\"0056\">Each elevator piston rod <b>170</b> can be extended and retracted through the respective elevator chamber aperture <b>174</b> by a corresponding one of a plurality of piston actuators <b>182</b>, as controlled by the CCS <b>700</b>. More particularly, prior to the seeds being deposited in the elevator chambers <b>164</b>, the CCS <b>700</b> commands the piston actuators <b>182</b> to retract the piston rods <b>170</b> to a retracted position where the recessed distal ends of each piston rod <b>170</b> is substantially flush with the bottom of each respective elevator chamber <b>164</b> within the respective aperture <b>174</b>, as exemplarily illustrated by the six leftmost piston rods <b>170</b> in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3C</figref>. Then once the seeds are deposited into the elevator chambers <b>164</b>, the seeds are retained and cradled within the respective piston rod recesses <b>180</b>, until such time as the CCS <b>700</b> commands the piston actuators to extend the piston rods <b>170</b> to an extended position, as exemplarily illustrated in phantom by the two rightmost piston rods <b>170</b> in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3C</figref>. Extending the piston rods <b>170</b> raises each respective seed out of the respective elevator chamber <b>164</b> to a cued position where the set of seeds are presented for removal, processing and sampling by a RVC bank <b>204</b>, as describe below.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0058\" num=\"0057\">Referring now to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, as described above, the seed transport subsystem <b>200</b> includes a plurality of RVC banks <b>204</b> mounted to the transport carousel <b>208</b>. For simplicity and clarity, <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates a single RVC bank <b>204</b> mounted to the transport carousel <b>208</b>, however, it should be understood that seed transport subsystem <b>200</b> includes a plurality of RVC banks <b>204</b> mounted thereto. For example, in various embodiments, the seed transport subsystem <b>200</b> includes four RVC banks <b>204</b>, whereby each RVC bank <b>204</b> is mounted to one of four sides of the transport carousel <b>208</b>. Each RVC bank includes a plurality of rotary vacuum cup (RVC) devices <b>212</b> controllable by the CCS <b>700</b> to remove a set of cued seeds from the elevator piston rods <b>170</b> and sequentially transport the respective seed set to each of the imaging station <b>300</b>, the orientation station <b>400</b> and the sample and sort station <b>500</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0059\" num=\"0058\">Each RVC device <b>212</b> includes a vacuum cup <b>216</b> mounted to a first end of a rotary shaft <b>220</b>, and a friction plate <b>224</b> mounted to an opposing second end of the rotary shaft <b>220</b>. Each RVC device <b>212</b> additionally includes a shaft actuator <b>228</b> controllable by the CCS <b>700</b> to bidirectionally move the shaft <b>220</b>, vacuum cup <b>216</b> and friction plate <b>224</b> along the longitudinal axis of the rotary shaft <b>220</b>. That is, each actuator <b>228</b> is controlled by the CCS <b>700</b> to raise and lower the respective vacuum cup <b>216</b> as needed throughout operation of the seed sorter system <b>10</b>. Each vacuum cup <b>216</b> is communicatively connected to a vacuum source (not shown) that is controlled by the CCS <b>700</b> to selectively provide a vacuum at a tip <b>232</b> of each vacuum cup <b>216</b>. Each RVC device <b>212</b> further includes a biasing device <b>236</b>, e.g., a spring, configured to apply a constant force on the rotary shaft <b>220</b> in the X direction. The force applied in the X direction by the biasing devices <b>236</b> maintains a locking mechanism (not shown) of each respective RVC device <b>212</b> engaged. Engagement of the locking device prevents angular rotation of the respective rotary shaft <b>220</b> and vacuum cup <b>216</b> about the longitudinal axis of the rotary shaft <b>220</b> until the locking mechanism is disengaged, as described below.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0059\">In coordination with a set of seeds being loaded into the elevator chambers <b>164</b>, the CCS <b>700</b> positions an empty RVC bank <b>204</b>, i.e., an RVC bank <b>204</b> without a set of seeds retained by the respective vacuum cups <b>216</b>, above the elevator bank <b>166</b>. The RVC devices <b>212</b> are located and mounted to the transport carousel <b>208</b>, and the motor of the transport carousel <b>208</b> is controlled, such that when an RVC bank <b>204</b> is positioned adjacent the loading station <b>100</b>, the vacuum cup <b>216</b> of each RVC device <b>212</b> is positioned directly above a corresponding one of the elevator chambers <b>164</b>. More particularly, when an RVC bank <b>204</b> is positioned adjacent the loading station <b>100</b>, the vacuum cup <b>216</b> of each RVC device <b>212</b> is positioned directly above the elevator piston rod <b>170</b> of the corresponding elevator chamber <b>164</b>. Once the elevator chambers <b>164</b> are loaded with a set of seeds, and an empty RVC bank <b>204</b> is positioned adjacent the loading station <b>100</b>, the CCS <b>700</b> can command the elevator piston rods <b>170</b> to raise the set of seeds to the cued position. The RVC devices <b>212</b> are further located and mounted to the transport carousel <b>208</b>, such that when the elevator piston rods <b>170</b> are in the extended position, i.e., the set of seeds are cued, each seed is in light contact with, or close proximity to, the corresponding vacuum cup <b>216</b>. A vacuum is then provided to each vacuum cup tip <b>232</b>. The vacuum cup tips <b>232</b> are sized, and fabricated from a suitable material, such that when the vacuum is provided, each respective seed is firmly retained on the respective tip <b>232</b>. The CCS <b>700</b> then retracts the elevator piston rods <b>170</b> leaving the set of seeds firmly retained on the respective vacuum cup tips <b>232</b>. The retained set of seeds can then be positioned adjacent the imaging station <b>300</b>, via advancement of the transport carousel <b>204</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0061\" num=\"0060\">Referring now to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, in various embodiments, the imaging station <b>300</b> includes at least one imaging device <b>304</b> mounted to system support structure such that the one or more imaging devices <b>304</b> is/are positioned under the RVC bank <b>204</b> and the respective set of seeds when the set of seeds is advanced from the loading station <b>100</b>. In various embodiments, the imaging station <b>300</b> includes a first imaging device <b>304</b> positioned and operable to collect image data for a first one-half of the seed set, and a second imaging device <b>304</b> positioned and operable to collect image data for a second one-half of the seed set. More particularly, the first imaging device <b>304</b> is mounted to the system support structure such that a field of view of the first imaging device <b>304</b> includes a bottom side of a first half of the seeds positioned adjacent the imaging station <b>300</b>. And, the second imaging device <b>304</b> is mounted to the system support structure such that a field of view of the second imaging device <b>304</b> includes a bottom side of a second half of the seeds positioned adjacent the imaging station <b>300</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0062\" num=\"0061\">As used herein, reference to the bottom side of the seeds refers to the side of the seeds that is facing downward with respect to the orientation of each seed as retained by the respective vacuum cup <b>216</b>. As described above, the shape of the elevator chamber bottoms <b>178</b> and the shape of the recesses <b>180</b> at the distal ends of each elevator rod <b>170</b> are designed such that each seed is preferably retained on the vacuum cup tips <b>232</b> by one of the opposing broad sides of each respective seed. That is, each seed is preferably held on the respective vacuum cup <b>216</b> by one of the broader sides such that germ of the seed is viewable by the imaging device(s) <b>304</b> and the tip of each seed is pointing anywhere within a 360&#xb0; plane that is substantially orthogonal to the respective vacuum cup <b>216</b>. The imaging device(s) <b>304</b> may be any suitable imaging device selected in accordance with the imaging goals of seed sorter system <b>10</b>. For example, in connection with an analysis for external seed coat, the first imaging device <b>304</b> may comprise a digital camera operable in the visible light range. Alternatively, for internal seed analysis, the first imaging device <b>304</b> may comprise a camera operable in the near infra-red light range (see, U.S. application for patent Ser. No. 09/698,214, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference). Still further, the first imaging device <b>304</b> may comprise a camera which implements NMR/MRI imaging techniques (see, U.S. application for patent Ser. No. 09/739,871, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0063\" num=\"0062\">The imaging station <b>300</b> further includes a light source <b>312</b> mounted to system support structure for illuminating the field of view of the imaging device(s) <b>304</b>. The source <b>312</b> can be any type of light source suited for the particular imaging application of the seed sorter system <b>10</b>. For example, the light source <b>312</b> can be one or more incandescent lights, fluorescent lights, ultraviolet lights, infrared lights, etc. In various embodiments, the light source <b>312</b> comprises a bank of light emitting diodes (LEDs), e.g., 630 nm LEDs. For example, the light source <b>312</b> comprises a bank of LEDs wherein each seed in the seed set has a corresponding LED as the primary light source illuminating the respective seed. Additionally, in various embodiments, each vacuum cup <b>216</b> includes a dark colored, e.g., black, background disk <b>240</b> (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4B</figref>) that provides a dark background for each seed during imaging and prevents image data interference from system components and structure beyond the seeds and within the field of view of imaging device(s) <b>304</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0064\" num=\"0063\">The image data is transmitted to the CCS <b>700</b> and stored (at least temporarily) in an electronic data storage device of the CCS <b>700</b>. The CCS <b>700</b> analyzes the data to determine a directional orientation of the tip of each seed. That is, the CCS <b>700</b> analyzes the image data to determine which direction the tip of each individual seed is pointing within the 360&#xb0; plane substantially orthogonal to the respective vacuum cup <b>216</b>. For example, with reference to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref>, if a point on the 360&#xb0; plane that is directly opposite the transfer carousel <b>208</b> is considered the origin, i.e., 0&#xb0;, the CCS <b>700</b> may analyze the image data to determine that the tip one of the seeds in the seed set is oriented at 90&#xb0;, while the tip of another of the seeds in the seed set is oriented at 315&#xb0;, and the tip of yet another seed is oriented at 200&#xb0;, etc. Once the image data of the respective seed set is collected and transmitted to the CCS <b>700</b>, by the imaging device(s) <b>304</b>, the transfer carousel <b>208</b> is advanced to position the seed set adjacent the orientation station <b>400</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0065\" num=\"0064\">Referring now to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, in various embodiments, the orientation station <b>400</b> includes motor bank <b>404</b> that includes a plurality of rotary motors <b>408</b>, e.g., a number of rotary motors <b>408</b> equal to the number of RVC <b>212</b>, independently controlled by the CCS <b>700</b>. In some embodiments, the rotary motors <b>408</b> comprise stepper motors. Each motor <b>408</b> includes a rotary shaft <b>412</b> having a clutch plate <b>416</b> mounted to a distal end thereof. The motor bank <b>404</b> is mounted to a linear actuator <b>420</b>, e.g., a pneumatic slide, that is mounted to system support structure such that when the RVC bank <b>204</b> is positioned adjacent the orientation station <b>400</b>, each motor <b>408</b> is positioned directly above a respective one of the RVC devices <b>212</b>. More specifically, when the RVC bank <b>204</b> is positioned adjacent the orientation station <b>400</b>, the clutch plate <b>416</b> of each motor <b>408</b> is positioned directly above, and in alignment with, a respective one of the RVC friction plates <b>224</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0066\" num=\"0065\">Once the imaged set of seeds is advanced to the orientation station <b>400</b>, the actuator <b>420</b> lowers the motor bank <b>404</b> such that the clutch plates <b>416</b> of each motor <b>408</b> engage the corresponding friction plates <b>224</b> of the respective RVC device <b>212</b>. Additionally, the actuator <b>420</b> is lowered such that the clutch plates <b>416</b> apply force to each friction plate <b>224</b> in the Y direction that overcomes the force in the X direction applied by the RVC biasing devices <b>236</b>. Accordingly, each RVC friction plate <b>224</b>, rotary shaft <b>220</b> and vacuum cup <b>216</b> is moved downward, thereby disengaging the RVC locking mechanism and allowing each RVC friction plate <b>224</b>, rotary shaft <b>220</b> and vacuum cup <b>216</b> to rotate. Then, based on the analyzed image data collected at the imaging station <b>300</b>, each motor <b>408</b> is independently controlled by the CCS <b>700</b> to rotate the respective friction plates <b>224</b> and corresponding vacuum cups <b>216</b> to independently properly orient each respective seed for sampling at the sample and sort station <b>500</b>, as described below. More particularly, based on the analyzed image data for each independent seed, each motor <b>408</b> is independently controlled to rotate the respective seed such that the tip of the seed is oriented approximately at 0&#xb0;. More importantly, each seed is independently rotated, if necessary, to position the cap of the seed at approximately 180&#xb0; such that a sample can be removed from that cap of each seed at the sample and sort station <b>500</b>, as described below.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0067\" num=\"0066\">Once each seed of the set is oriented with the cap of each respective seed oriented, or positioned, at approximately 180&#xb0;, the CCS <b>700</b> commands the actuator <b>420</b> to raise the motor bank <b>404</b> to disengage the clutch plates <b>416</b> from the friction plates <b>224</b>. As the motor bank <b>404</b> is raised and the clutch plates <b>416</b> are disengaged from the friction plates <b>224</b>, the biasing devices <b>236</b> of each RVC device <b>212</b> move each respective rotary shaft in the X direction thereby engaging each respective locking device. Thus, each rotary cup <b>216</b> and corresponding seed held thereon, is maintained in the orientation with the seed cap at approximately the 180&#xb0; position, as illustrated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6B</figref>. The CCS <b>700</b> then advances the transfer carousel <b>208</b> to position the properly oriented seed set adjacent the sample and sort station <b>500</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0067\">Referring now to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6C</figref>, in various embodiments, the orientation station <b>400</b> further includes a seed purge hopper <b>424</b> for receiving the set of seeds held by the respective RVC bank <b>204</b>. The seed purge hopper <b>424</b> is mounted to system support structure such that a trough <b>428</b> of the seed purge hopper <b>424</b> is positioned under the vacuum cups <b>216</b> of the respective RVC bank <b>204</b> for receiving seeds discharged from the respective vacuum cups <b>216</b>. More specifically, the seed purge hopper <b>424</b> can be utilized to offload all the seeds held by each RVC bank <b>204</b> of the seed transport subsystem <b>200</b>. To offload all the seeds, each RVC bank <b>204</b> is sequentially advanced to the orientation station <b>400</b> at which time the vacuum source being supplied to each respective vacuum cup <b>216</b> is terminated. When the supplied vacuum is terminated, the seeds are released from the vacuum cups <b>216</b> and fall into the seed purge hopper trough <b>428</b> where they can be collected and returned to the bulk seed hopper <b>104</b> at a later time. Thus, if operation of the seed sorting system <b>10</b> needs to be terminated, all the seeds held by the RVC banks <b>204</b> can be purged and collected.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0068\">In various embodiments, the seed sorting system <b>10</b> includes an emergency stop button <b>22</b>, shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, for stopping and shutting down the seed sorting system <b>10</b>. For example, in the case of an emergency, the emergency stop button <b>22</b> can be depressed and the all operation of the seed sorting system <b>10</b> would cease. Also, in various embodiments, the seed sorting system <b>10</b> includes a system pause button <b>26</b>, shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, for temporarily pausing operation of the seed sorting system <b>10</b>. For example, if a jam occurred in one of the first transfer tubes <b>126</b> of the seed loading station <b>100</b> such that one or more RVC banks did not &#x2018;pick up&#x2019; a full set of seeds, the system pause button could be depressed to pause operation of the seed sorting system <b>10</b>. In the paused state, the vacuum source can remain actuated such that all seeds are retained by the respective RVC vacuum cups <b>216</b> until such time as the seeds are purged into the seed purge hopper <b>424</b> or operation is reinitiated and the seeds are sampled, as described below.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0069\">Referring now to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref>, in various embodiments, the seed sample and sort station <b>500</b> includes a seed sampling subsystem <b>510</b> and a seed and sample sorting subsystem <b>570</b>. The seed sampling subsystem <b>510</b> is controllable by the CCS <b>700</b> to extract a sample from each seed in the respective seed set positioned adjacent the seed sample and sort station <b>500</b>. The seed and sample sorting subsystem <b>570</b> is additionally controllable by the CCS <b>700</b> to sort the sampled seeds to the seed trays <b>18</b> and sort the corresponding seed sample to the sample trays <b>14</b> while tracking and mapping the locations of the corresponding sampled seeds and seed samples in the respective seed and sample trays <b>18</b> and <b>14</b>. The locations of the seed samples and the locations of the corresponding sampled seeds in the trays <b>14</b> and <b>18</b> are matched so that the sampled seed may later be correlated to the sample taken therefrom (e.g., after analysis of the sample, etc.).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0070\">Referring now to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 8A, 8B, 8C and 8D</figref>, in various embodiments, the seed sampling subsystem <b>510</b> includes a plurality of seed grip and chip assemblies <b>512</b>, e.g., a number of seed grip and chip assemblies <b>512</b> equal to the number of RVC devices <b>212</b> included in each RVC bank <b>204</b>. The seed sampling subsystem <b>510</b> additionally includes a press plate bank <b>514</b> mounted to a linear actuator <b>516</b>, e.g., a pneumatic slide. The press plate bank <b>514</b> includes a plurality of press plates <b>518</b> fixedly mounted to a press plate bank header <b>520</b> that is coupled to the linear actuator <b>516</b>. The actuator <b>516</b> is mounted to system support structure such that when the RVC bank <b>204</b> is positioned adjacent the sample and sort station <b>500</b>, each press plate <b>518</b> is positioned directly above a respective one of the RVC devices <b>212</b>. More specifically, when the RVC bank <b>204</b> is positioned adjacent the orientation station <b>400</b>, each press plate <b>518</b> is positioned directly above, and in alignment with, a respective one of the RVC friction plates <b>224</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0071\">Once the oriented set of seeds is advanced to the sample and sort station <b>500</b>, the actuator <b>516</b> lowers the push plate bank <b>514</b> such that the push plates <b>518</b> engage the corresponding friction plates <b>224</b> of the respective RVC device <b>212</b>. As the actuator <b>420</b> is lowered, the push plates <b>518</b> apply force to each friction plate <b>224</b> in the Y direction that overcomes the force in the X direction applied by the RVC biasing devices <b>236</b>. Accordingly, each RVC friction plate <b>224</b>, rotary shaft <b>220</b> and vacuum cup <b>216</b> is moved downward, thereby disengaging the RVC locking mechanism. However, since the press plates <b>518</b> are fixedly mounted to the header <b>520</b>, each RVC friction plate <b>224</b>, rotary shaft <b>220</b> and vacuum cup <b>216</b> can not rotate and each seed remains properly oriented as it is moved downward in the Y direction.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0072\">With particular reference to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 8B and 8D</figref>, in accordance with various embodiments, each grip and chip assembly <b>512</b> includes a seed gripping mechanism <b>522</b> and a sample extraction mechanism <b>524</b>. Although, each grip and chip assembly <b>512</b> is independently controlled by the CCS <b>700</b>, the structure and function for each grip and chip assembly <b>512</b> is substantially identical. Therefore, the structure and function of the plurality of grip and chip assemblies will be described herein with reference to a single grip and chip assembly <b>512</b>. The seed gripping mechanism <b>522</b> is operable, as controlled by the CCS <b>700</b>, to firmly hold each respective seed as the sample extraction mechanism <b>524</b> removes a portion, i.e., a sample, of the seed coat and inner seed material from the crown of the respective seed. The extracted sample can then be utilized to test and analyze the various traits of the respective seed. Importantly, the sample is extracted from the crown in a non-destructive manner such that germination viability of the seeds can be preserved.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0073\">In various embodiments, the seed gripping mechanism <b>522</b> includes an actuator <b>526</b>, e.g., a pneumatic clamp, that is controllable by the CCS <b>660</b> to bidirectionally move a pair of opposing actuator arms <b>528</b> toward and away from each other, i.e., open and close the actuator arms <b>528</b>. For example, in various embodiments, the actuator <b>526</b> is operable to move the opposing actuator arms <b>528</b> toward and away from each other along the line M (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8B</figref>). The actuator arms <b>528</b> are structured to removably retain a pair of opposing seed gripping fingers <b>530</b> structured to firmly hold the respective seed as the sample is extracted by the sample extraction mechanism <b>524</b>, as described below. An exemplary gripping finger <b>530</b> is illustrated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8C</figref>. Each gripping finger <b>530</b> includes a head <b>532</b> having a contoured face <b>534</b>. The face <b>534</b> can be shaped or formed to have any conformation suitable for firmly and steadily holding the respective seed as the sample is extracted. In various embodiments, the face <b>534</b> is particularly designed to have a wedge-like conformation such that as the actuator <b>526</b> closes gripping fingers <b>530</b> around the seed, the seed is forced toward a cutting wheel <b>540</b> of the sample extraction mechanism <b>524</b> and into abutment with a justification block <b>562</b> of the sample extraction mechanism <b>524</b>. The justification block <b>562</b> includes a cutting wheel guide slot <b>533</b> that allows the cutting wheel <b>540</b> access to seed. Thus, the gripping fingers <b>530</b> firmly and justification block <b>562</b> hold the seed on three sides and prevent the respective seed from moving in a direction away from the sample extraction mechanism <b>524</b> as the sample is being extracted. In various embodiments, the gripping finger head <b>532</b> is connected to, or integrally formed with, a mounting post <b>536</b> structured to fit within, or mate with, a mounting hole <b>538</b> in each actuator arm <b>528</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0074\">When the RVC bank <b>204</b> and properly oriented seed set are advanced to the seed sample and sort station <b>500</b>, the CCS <b>700</b> commands the seed gripping actuator <b>526</b> to open the actuator arms <b>528</b> such that the gripping finger faces <b>534</b> have a space between them large enough to allow a seed to be easily positioned therebetween. The CCS <b>700</b> then commands the press plate bank actuator <b>516</b> to lower the press plate bank <b>514</b> to engage the press plates <b>518</b> with the friction plates <b>224</b>. More particularly, the force on the friction plates <b>224</b> moves the vacuum cups <b>216</b> and respective seed downward toward a sampling position, i.e., the gap between gripping fingers <b>530</b>. Each grip and chip system <b>512</b> is mounted to system support structure such that each sampling position, or gap, between the gripping finger faces <b>534</b> is precisely aligned below the respective vacuum cup tip <b>232</b>. Thus, when the press plate bank actuator <b>516</b> pushes the friction plates <b>224</b>, vacuum cups <b>216</b> and oriented seeds downward, the oriented seeds are moved to the sampling positions between the gripping fingers <b>530</b> of the respective seed gripping mechanism <b>522</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0076\" num=\"0075\">The CCS <b>700</b> then commands the seed gripping actuator <b>526</b> to close the actuator arms <b>528</b> such that the gripping finger faces <b>534</b> engage the respective seed to firmly retain the seed without damaging the seed. Once the seed is firmly retained between the gripping fingers <b>530</b>, the push plate bank actuator can be commanded to raise, and the vacuum provided at the vacuum cup tip <b>232</b> terminated, to thereby release the respective seed. Or, alternatively, the CCS <b>700</b> can maintain the vacuum cup <b>216</b> in contact with the seed to provide additionally support for the seed as the sample is being extracted.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0077\" num=\"0076\">The sample extraction mechanism <b>524</b> includes cutting wheel <b>540</b> rotationally mounted within a cutting wheel fixture <b>542</b> and rotationally driven by a cutting wheel motor <b>544</b>. Although the cutting wheel <b>540</b> is shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8B</figref> to be belt driven by the cutting wheel motor <b>544</b>, alternatively the cutting wheel <b>540</b> can be shaft driven, chain driven, direct gear driven, etc., by the cutting wheel motor <b>544</b> and remain within the scope of the present disclosure. The cutting wheel <b>540</b> is mounted on a shaft <b>546</b> that is rotationally mounted within the cutting wheel fixture <b>542</b>. Additionally, a drive wheel <b>548</b> is mounted to, or formed with, the shaft and operatively coupled to the cutting wheel motor <b>544</b>, for example, by a drive belt <b>550</b>, such that actuation of the motor <b>544</b> will rotate the drive wheel <b>548</b>, shaft <b>546</b> and cutting wheel <b>540</b> within the cutting wheel fixture <b>542</b>. More specifically, the cutting wheel <b>540</b> is mounted to the shaft <b>546</b> in a cam fashion, e.g., the shaft <b>546</b> can be an offset shaft, such that as the drive wheel <b>548</b> and shaft <b>546</b> are rotated by the motor <b>544</b>, a peripheral cutting edge <b>552</b> of the cutting wheel <b>540</b> rotates and progressively moves toward the seed gripping mechanism <b>552</b>, and specifically toward the seed retained between the gripping fingers <b>530</b>. The cutting edge <b>552</b> comprises an abrasive or sharp-edged surface, e.g., a saw-toothed surface, that will remove the seed coat and inner seed material from the crown of the respective seed. Thus, as the cutting wheel <b>540</b> is rotated, the cutting edge <b>552</b> will contact and begin to cut or abrade the seed crown. As the cutting wheel <b>540</b> continues to rotate, the cutting edge <b>552</b> will penetrate a desired depth or distance into the crown, depending on the amount of angular rotation of the cutting wheel <b>540</b>, as controlled by the CCS <b>700</b>. That is, the greater the amount of angular rotation of the cutting the wheel <b>540</b>, the deeper the cutting edge <b>552</b> will penetrate into the seed crown and the more sample that will be extracted.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0078\" num=\"0077\">The seed gripping mechanism <b>522</b> additionally includes a seed dump bowl <b>554</b> (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8D</figref>) having a drain port <b>556</b> formed in the bottom of the dump bowl <b>554</b>. The dump bowl <b>554</b> is shaped to funnel a sampled seed into the drain port <b>556</b> after a sample has been removed from the respective seed and the seed is released from being held between the gripper fingers <b>530</b>. A drain tube <b>558</b> (shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>) is connected to the drain port <b>556</b> to transfer the released seed to one of the seed trays <b>18</b> positioned below the grip and chip assembly <b>512</b>, as describe below. The seed gripping mechanism <b>522</b> further includes a sample extraction orifice <b>560</b> located in the justification block <b>562</b>, below the cutting wheel guide <b>533</b>, such that cutting edge <b>552</b> and periphery portion of the cutting wheel <b>540</b> extends over the sample extraction orifice <b>560</b>. A sample extraction tube <b>564</b> (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>) is connected to the sample extraction orifice <b>560</b> and a vacuum is controllably provided to the sample extraction tube <b>564</b> and thus, at the sample extraction orifice <b>560</b>. As the cutting wheel <b>540</b> removes the sample from the respective seed, the vacuum provided at the sample extraction orifice <b>560</b>, via the sample extraction tube <b>564</b>, draws the sample into the sample extraction orifice <b>560</b>. The sample is then passed through the sample extraction tube <b>564</b> and deposited into one of the sample trays <b>14</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0079\" num=\"0078\">Therefore, once the seed is retained between the gripping fingers <b>530</b>, the CCS <b>700</b> commands the cutting wheel motor <b>544</b> to angularly rotate the drive wheel <b>548</b> through a predetermined angle and at a predetermined rate of rotation. For example, the CCS <b>700</b> can command the cutting wheel motor <b>554</b> to rotate the drive wheel <b>548</b> ninety-five degrees at thirty revolutions-per-minute (RPMs). Accordingly, the cutting wheel <b>540</b> is rotated through the predetermined angle, at the predetermined RPMs. As the cutting wheel <b>540</b> rotates, the cam action of cutting wheel <b>540</b> mounting rotates and advances the cutting edge <b>552</b> toward and into the seed, thereby removing a sample from the respective seed. As the sample is removed, the vacuum at the sample extraction orifice <b>560</b> draws the sample into the sample extraction tube <b>564</b> where the sample is transferred to one of the sample trays <b>14</b>. The CCS <b>700</b> then commands the cutting wheel motor <b>544</b> to reverse the direction of rotation to withdraw the cutting wheel <b>540</b> from the seed and return the cutting wheel to a home position, ready to remove a sample from a subsequent seed. Subsequent to, or substantially simultaneously with the withdrawal of the cutting wheel <b>540</b>, the CCS <b>700</b> commands the seed gripping mechanism <b>522</b> to release the sampled seed, allowing the seed to fall, via gravity, vacuum or forced air, into the drain tube <b>556</b> to transfer the sampled seed to one of seed trays <b>18</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0080\" num=\"0079\">Referring now to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8E</figref>, in various embodiments, the cutting wheel <b>540</b> is structured to have a saw-toothed cutting edge <b>552</b> that includes a plurality of teeth <b>566</b>. Moreover, each tooth <b>566</b> includes a lateral cutting tip <b>568</b> that is formed to avoid movement, e.g., &#x2018;chattering&#x2019;, of the seed being sampled and allow the seed to remain stationary within the gripping fingers <b>530</b>. For example, the lateral cutting tip <b>568</b> of each tooth can have a specific angle &#x3b1;, e.g, a 60&#xb0; angle, such that as the cutting wheel <b>540</b> cuts through the respective seed, a leading end of the cutting tip <b>568</b> of each subsequent tooth <b>566</b> engages the seed before a trailing end of the cutting tip <b>568</b> of each preceding tooth <b>566</b> disengages the seed.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0081\" num=\"0080\">In various embodiments, each cutting wheel <b>540</b>, i.e., each cutting wheel motor <b>544</b>, is independently controlled by the CCS <b>700</b>, but each cutting wheel <b>540</b> is commanded to have approximately the same rotational speed and/or angular rotation. Therefore, when a set of seeds is held within the seed gripping mechanisms <b>522</b>, the respective cutting wheels <b>540</b> are each commanded to rotate through approximately the same angle of rotation and at the same speed. Accordingly, the cam rotation of the cutting wheels <b>540</b>, as described above, will advance the respective cutting wheels <b>540</b> approximately the same distance toward each of the seed. Thus, smaller seeds may not have the same amount of sample extracted as larger seeds. In such embodiments, the rotational speed and/or amount of angular rotation for each cutting wheel <b>540</b> is determined by empirical data and programmed into the CCS <b>700</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0082\" num=\"0081\">In various other embodiments, each cutting wheel <b>540</b>, i.e., each cutting wheel motor <b>544</b>, is independently controlled by the CCS <b>700</b>. Therefore, the rotational speed and/or amount of angular rotation for each independent cutting wheel <b>540</b> can be controlled and adjusted for each seed positioned and held by the seed gripping mechanism <b>522</b> of each respective grip and chip assembly <b>512</b>. For example, the seed held within a seed gripping mechanism <b>522</b> of a first grip and chip assembly <b>512</b> may be smaller in size than a seed held within a seed gripping mechanism <b>522</b> of an adjacent second grip and chip assembly <b>512</b>. In such a case, the cutting wheel <b>540</b> of first grip and chip assembly <b>512</b> can be commanded to have a greater angular rotation than the cutting wheel <b>540</b> of second grip and chip assembly <b>512</b>. Therefore, the cam rotation of the cutting wheels <b>540</b>, as described above, will advance the cutting wheel <b>540</b> of the first chip and grip assembly <b>512</b> further toward the smaller seed such that approximately equal amounts of sample will be extracted from the smaller seed as from the larger seed. Furthermore, in such embodiments, the rotational speed and/or amount of angular rotation for each independent cutting wheel is based on the imaging data collected for each respective seed at the imaging station <b>300</b>.</p>\n",

More specifically, the sample extraction orifice <b>560</b> of each grip and chip assembly <b>512</b> has a first end of a respective sample extraction tube <b>564</b> connected thereto, and a second end of each respective sample extraction tube <b>564</b> is connected to a sample extraction nozzle (SEN) manifold <b>572</b>. The SEN manifold <b>572</b> includes a manifold block <b>574</b> to which the sample extraction tubes <b>564</b> are connected, and from which a plurality of exhaust tubes <b>578</b> extend, e.g., a number of exhaust tubes <b>578</b> equal to the number of sample extraction tubes <b>564</b> can extend from the manifold block <b>574</b>. The SEN manifold <b>572</b> additionally includes a plurality of discharge nozzles <b>580</b> that are in fluid communication with the extraction tubes <b>564</b>.

The first and second linear actuators <b>590</b> and <b>592</b> are controlled by the CCS <b>700</b> to precisely move the sample tray platform <b>582</b> in two dimensions. More particularly, the first and second actuators <b>590</b> and <b>592</b> move the sample tray platform <b>582</b> within an X-Y coordinate system to precisely position any selected group of adjacent wells <b>30</b> of any one or more selected sample trays <b>14</b> at a target location directly beneath the SEN manifold <b>572</b>.</p>\n",

The CCS <b>700</b> then commands the SEN manifold actuator <b>594</b> to lower the SEN manifold <b>572</b> to position each of the discharge nozzles <b>580</b> in alignment with and in close proximity to, or in contact with, a corresponding one of the wells <b>30</b>. Once the selected group of wells <b>30</b> is positioned at the target location and the SEN manifold <b>572</b> is lowered, the CCS <b>700</b> commands the grip and chip assemblies <b>512</b> to extract the samples from the respective seeds. Each sample is drawn into a corresponding sample extraction tube <b>564</b>, as described above, and the vacuum provided to each sample extraction tube <b>564</b> transfers each sample through the respective sample extraction tube <b>564</b> to the corresponding discharge nozzle <b>580</b>. Each seed is then discharged into the corresponding sample tray wells <b>30</b>. The SEN manifold actuator <b>594</b> then raises the SEN manifold <b>572</b>, a subsequent group of wells <b>30</b> is positioned at the target position, and the SEN manifold <b>572</b> is lowered in preparation for a subsequent set of samples to be extracted and deposited into the wells <b>30</b>.</p>\n",

Thus, the seals <b>596</b> ensure that substantially all the sample being discharged from each discharge nozzle <b>580</b> is deposited into the corresponding well <b>30</b> without cross-contamination by adjacent samples escaping around the discharge nozzles <b>580</b>. The seals <b>596</b> can be any seal suitable for creating a seal between each discharge nozzle <b>580</b> and the corresponding well <b>30</b>, e.g., an O-ring, gasket or bushing.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0088\" num=\"0087\">As the sample trays <b>14</b> are placed on the sample tray platform <b>582</b>, a tray identification number, e.g., a bar code, for each sample tray <b>14</b> and the location of each sample tray <b>14</b> on the platform <b>582</b> is recorded. Additionally, as each extracted sample is deposited into a well <b>30</b>, an X-Y location of the well <b>30</b> on the sample tray platform <b>582</b> is recorded. The recorded tray and well positions on the sample tray platform <b>582</b> can then be compared to the X-Y locations of each deposited extracted sample, to map the specific extracted sample in each well <b>30</b> of each sample tray <b>14</b>. In various embodiments, the sample tray platform <b>582</b> is removably coupled to the X-Y stage <b>584</b> such that one or more sample tray platforms <b>582</b> can be loaded with the sample trays <b>14</b> offline, i.e., away from the seed sorter system <b>10</b>, and conveniently coupled to and decoupled from the X-Y stage <b>584</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0089\" num=\"0088\">Additionally, in various embodiments, the extraction tubes <b>564</b> are fabricated from static dissipative tubing so that a portion of the extracted samples do not stick to the inside walls of the extraction tubes <b>564</b> and cause cross-contamination of the samples. Furthermore, in various embodiments, the seed and sample sorting subsystem is structured and operable to &#x2018;blow out&#x2019; the extraction tubes <b>564</b> and discharge nozzles <b>580</b> between cycles. Therefore, any sample residue accumulated in the extraction tubes <b>564</b> and discharge nozzles <b>580</b> is cleaned out between cycles. For example, air pressure can be drawn or forced through the extraction tubes <b>564</b> and discharge nozzles <b>580</b> and exhausted into the exhaust tubes <b>578</b>. The exhaust tubes <b>578</b> can be coupled to an exhaust manifold <b>598</b> that carries any residual sample particles to collection chambers <b>600</b>, where the particles are filtered out of the exhausted air, i.e., separated from the exhausted air.</p>\n",

Each seed tray <b>18</b> includes a plurality of seed wells <b>34</b>, each of which are adapted for receiving a seed after the respective seed has been sampled by one of the grip and chip assemblies <b>512</b>. For example, in various embodiments, each seed tray <b>18</b> can be a twenty-four well tray. The bank of grip and chip assemblies <b>512</b> is mounted to system support structure above the seed tray platform <b>602</b> such that seeds can be dispensed through the drain tubes <b>558</b> into selected seed wells <b>30</b> of selected seed trays <b>18</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0091\" num=\"0090\">The seed tray platform <b>602</b> is mounted to an X-Y stage <b>604</b>.

      "<p id=\"p-0092\" num=\"0091\">The first and second linear actuators <b>610</b> and <b>612</b> are controlled by the CCS <b>700</b> to precisely move the seed tray platform <b>602</b> in two dimensions. More particularly, the first and second actuators <b>610</b> and <b>612</b> move the seed tray platform <b>602</b> within an X-Y coordinate system to precisely position any selected well <b>34</b> of any selected seed tray <b>18</b> at a target location beneath a selected one or more of the drain tubes <b>558</b>.

Therefore, when each of the seed gripping mechanisms <b>522</b> releases the respective sampled seeds, each sampled seed will fall, via gravity, vacuum or forced air, through the respective drain tube <b>558</b> into the corresponding well <b>34</b> located beneath the respective drain tube <b>558</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0093\" num=\"0092\">In operation, just prior to, simultaneously with, or just after the set of seeds is retained by the seed gripping mechanisms <b>522</b>, as described above, the CCS <b>700</b> positions the selected well <b>34</b>, or selected group of wells <b>34</b>, at the target location.

In various embodiments, the one or more of the seeds can be sequentially released and the seed tray platform <b>602</b> sequentially repositioned to deposit the one or more seeds into selected wells <b>34</b>. In other embodiments, the seed tray platform is manipulated to position a group of linearly adjacent wells beneath the linearly aligned drain tubes, all the seeds are then substantially simultaneously released and deposited into the respective group of linearly adjacent wells.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0094\" num=\"0093\">As the seed trays <b>18</b> are placed on the seed tray platform <b>602</b>, a tray identification number, e.g., a bar code, for each seed tray <b>18</b> and the location of each seed tray <b>18</b> on the seed tray platform <b>602</b> is recorded.

In various embodiments, the number and arrangement of the wells <b>34</b> in the seed trays <b>18</b> corresponds to the number and arrangement of the wells <b>30</b> in the sample trays <b>14</b>.

      "<p id=\"p-0096\" num=\"0095\">As described above, the sampling systems and methods of this disclosure protect germination viability of the seeds so as to be non-destructive. Germination viability means that a predominant number of sampled seeds (i.e., greater than 50% of all sampled seeds) remain viable after sampling. In some particular embodiments, at least about 75% of sampled seeds, and in some embodiments at least about 85% of sampled seeds remain viable. It should be noted that lower rates of germination viability may be tolerable under certain circumstances or for certain applications, for example, as genotyping costs decrease with time because a greater number of seeds could be sampled for the same genotype cost.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0097\" num=\"0096\">In yet other embodiments, germination viability is maintained for at least about six months after sampling to ensure that the sampled seed will be viable until it reaches the field for planting. In some particular embodiments, the methods of the present disclosure further comprise treating the sampled seeds to maintain germination viability. Such treatment may generally include any means known in the art for protecting a seed from environmental conditions while in storage or transport. For example, in some embodiments, the sampled seeds may be treated with a polymer and/or a fungicide to protect the sampled seed while in storage or in transport to the field before planting.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0098\" num=\"0097\">In various embodiments, the samples of the present disclosure are used in a high-throughput, non-destructive method for analyzing individual seeds in a population of seeds. The method comprises removing a sample from the seed while preserving the germination viability of the seed; and screening the sample for the presence or absence of one or more characteristics indicative of a genetic or chemical trait. The method may further comprise selecting seeds from the population based on the results of the screening; and cultivating plants from the selected seed.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0099\" num=\"0098\">Although the present disclosure exemplarily describes the high-throughput sampling of maize seeds, one skilled in the art would recognize that any seed can generally be utilized in a method or device of the present invention. For example, in various embodiments, the seed can be selected from the group consisting of alfalfa seed, apple seed, banana seed, barley seed, broccoli seed, cabbage seed, canola seed, carrot seed, castorbean seed, cauliflower seed, Chinese cabbage seed, citrus seed, clover seed, coconut seed, coffee seed, maize seed, cotton seed, cucumber seed, Douglas fir seed, dry bean seed, eggplant seed, Eucalyptus seed, fennel seed, garden bean seed, gourd seed, leek seed, lettuce seed, Loblolly pine seed, linseed seed, melon seed, oat seed, okra seed, olive seed, onion seed, palm seed, pea seed, peanut seed, pepper seed, poplar seed, pumpkin seed, Radiata pine seed, radish seed, rapeseed seed, rice seed, rye seed, spinach seed, sorghum seed, squash seed, Southern pine seed, soybean seed, strawberry seed, sugarbeet seed, sugarcane seed, sunflower seed, sweet corn seed, sweetgum seed, tea seed, tobacco seed, tomato seed, turf seed, watermelon seed, wheat seed, and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana </i>seed. In a more particular embodiment, the seed is selected from the group consisting of cotton seed, cucumber seed, maize seed, soybean seed, rapeseed seed, rice seed, okra seed, watermelon seed and wheat seed. In an even more particular embodiment, the seed is a maize seed, a cotton seed, a cucumber seed or a watermelon seed.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0100\" num=\"0099\">DNA may be extracted from the sample using any DNA extraction methods known to those of skill in the art which will provide sufficient DNA yield, DNA quality, and PCR response. A non-limiting example of suitable DNA-extraction methods is SDS-based extraction with centrifugation. In addition, the extracted DNA may be amplified after extraction using any amplification method known to those skilled in the art. For example, one suitable amplification method is the GenomiPhi&#xae; DNA amplification prep from Amersham Biosciences.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0101\" num=\"0100\">The extracted DNA is screened for the presence or absence of a suitable genetic marker. A wide variety of genetic markers are available and known to those of skill in the art. The DNA screening for the presence or absence of the genetic marker can be used for the selection of seeds in a breeding population. The screening may be used to select for QTL, alleles, or genomic regions (haplotypes). The alleles, QTL, or haplotypes to be selected for can be identified using newer techniques of molecular biology with modifications of classical breeding strategies.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0102\" num=\"0101\">In other various embodiments, the seed is selected based on the presence or absence of a genetic marker that is genetically linked with a QTL. Examples of QTLs which are often of interest include but are not limited to yield, lodging resistance, height, maturity, disease resistance, pest resistance, resistance to nutrient deficiency, grain composition, herbicide tolerance, fatty acid content, protein or carbohydrate metabolism, increased oil content, increased nutritional content, stress tolerance, organoleptic properties, morphological characteristics, other agronomic traits, traits for industrial uses, traits for improved consumer appeal, and a combination of traits as a multiple trait index. Alternatively, the seed can be selected based on the presence or absence of a marker that is genetically linked with a haplotype associated with a QTL. Examples of such QTL may again include, without limitation, yield, lodging resistance, height, maturity, disease resistance, pest resistance, resistance to nutrient deficiency, grain composition, herbicide tolerance, fatty acid content, protein or carbohydrate metabolism, increased oil content, increased nutritional content, stress tolerance, organoleptic properties, morphological characteristics, other agronomic traits, traits for industrial uses, traits for improved consumer appeal, and a combination of traits as a multiple trait index.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0103\" num=\"0102\">Selection of a breeding population could be initiated as early as the F<sub>2 </sub>breeding level, if homozygous inbred parents are used in the initial breeding cross. An F<sub>1 </sub>generation could also be sampled and advanced if one or more of the parents of the cross are heterozygous for the alleles or markers of interest. The breeder may screen an F<sub>2 </sub>population to retrieve the marker genotype of every individual in the population. Initial population sizes, limited only by the number of available seeds for screening, can be adjusted to meet the desired probability of successfully identifying the desired number of individuals. See Sedcole, J. R. &#x201c;Number of plants necessary to recover a trait.&#x201d; Crop Sci. 17:667-68 (1977). Accordingly, the probability of finding the desired genotype, the initial population size, and the targeted resulting population size can be modified for various breeding methodologies and inbreeding level of the sampled population.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0104\" num=\"0103\">The selected seeds may be bulked or kept separate depending on the breeding methodology and target. For example, when a breeder is screening an F<sub>2 </sub>population for disease resistance, all individuals with the desired genotype may be bulked and planted in the breeding nursery. Conversely, if multiple QTL with varying effects for a trait such as grain yield are being selected from a given population, the breeder may keep individual identity preserved, going to the field to differentiate individuals with various combinations of the target QTL.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0105\" num=\"0104\">Several methods of preserving single seed identity can be used while transferring seed from a sampling facility to the field. Methods include, but are not limited to, transferring selected individuals to seed tape, a cassette tray, or indexing tray, transplanting with peat pots, and hand-planting from individual seed packets. Multiple cycles of selection can be utilized depending on breeding targets and genetic complexity.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0106\" num=\"0105\">The screening methods of the disclosure may further be used in a breeding program for introgressing a trait into a plant. Such methods comprise removing a sample comprising cells with DNA from seeds in a population, screening the DNA extracted from each seed for the presence or absence of at least one genetic marker, selecting seeds from the population based upon the results of the DNA screening; cultivating a fertile plant from the seed; and utilizing the fertile plant as either a female parent or male parent in a cross with another plant.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0107\" num=\"0106\">Examples of genetic screening to select seeds for trait integration include, without limitation, identification of high recurrent parent allele frequencies, tracking of transgenes of interest or screening for the absence of unwanted transgenes, selection of hybrid testing seed, and zygosity testing.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0108\" num=\"0107\">The identification of high recurrent pair allele frequencies via the screening methods of the present disclosure again allows for a reduced number of rows per population and an increased number of populations, or inbred lines, to be planted in a given field unit. Thus, the screening methods of the present disclosure may also effectively reduce the resources required to complete the conversion of inbred lines.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0109\" num=\"0108\">The methods of the present disclosure further provide quality assurance (QA) and quality control by assuring that regulated or unwanted transgenes are identified and discarded prior to planting.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0110\" num=\"0109\">The methods of the present disclosure may be further applied to identify hybrid seed for transgene testing. For example, in a conversion of an inbred line at the BCnF<sub>1 </sub>stage, a breeder could effectively create a hybrid seed lot (barring gamete selection) that was 50% hemizygous for the trait of interest and 50% homozygous for the lack of the trait in order to generate hybrid seed for testing. The breeder could then screen all F<sub>1 </sub>seeds produced in the test cross and identify and select those seeds that were hemizygous. Such method is advantageous in that inferences from the hybrid trials would represent commercial hybrid genetics with regard to trait zygosity.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0111\" num=\"0110\">Other applications of the screening methods of this disclosure for identifying and tracking traits of interest carry the same advantages identified above with respect to required field and labor resources. Generally, transgenic conversion programs are executed in multi-season locations which carry a much higher land and management cost structure. As such, the impact of either reducing the row needs per population or increasing the number of populations within a given field unit are significantly more dramatic on a cost basis versus temperate applications.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0112\" num=\"0111\">Still further, the screening methods of this disclosure may be used to improve the efficiency of the doubled haploid program through selection of desired genotypes at the haploid stage and identification of ploidy level to eliminate non-haploid seeds from being processed and advancing to the field. Both applications again result in the reduction of field resources per population and the capability to evaluate a larger number of populations within a given field unit.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0113\" num=\"0112\">In various embodiments, the disclosure further provides an assay for predicting embryo zygosity for a particular gene of interest (GOI). The assay predicts embryo zygosity based on the ratio of the relative copy numbers of a GOI and of an internal control (IC) gene per cell or per genome. Generally, this assay uses an IC gene that is of known zygosity, e.g., homozygous at the locus (two IC copies per diploid cell), for normalizing measurement of the GOI. The ratio of the relative copy numbers of the IC to the GOI predicts the GOI copy number in the cell. In a homozygous cell, for any given gene (or unique genetic sequence), the gene copy number is equal to the cell's ploidy level since the sequence is present at the same locus in all homologous chromosomes. When a cell is heterozygous for a particular gene, the gene copy number will be lower than the cell's ploidy level. The zygosity of a cell at any locus can thus be determined by the gene copy number in the cell.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0114\" num=\"0113\">In some particular embodiments, the disclosure provides an assay for predicting corn embryo zygosity. In corn seed, the endosperm tissue is triploid, whereas the embryo tissue is diploid. Endosperm that is homozygous for the IC will contain three IC copies. Endosperm GOI copy number can range from 0 (homozygous negative) to 3 (homozygous positive); and endosperm GOI copy number of 1 or 2 is found in seed heterozygous for the GOI (or hemizygous for the GOI if the GOI is a transgene). Endosperm copy number is reflective of the zygosity of the embryo: a homozygous (positive or negative) endosperm accompanies a homozygous embryo, heterozygous endosperm (whether a GOI copy number of 1 or 2) reflects a heterozygous (GOI copy number of 1) embryo. The endosperm GOI copy number (which can range from 0 to 3 copies) can be determined from the ratio of endosperm IC copy number to endosperm GOI copy number (which can range from 0/3 to 3/3, that is, from 0 to 1), which can then be used to predict zygosity of the embryo.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0115\" num=\"0114\">Copy numbers of the GOI or of the IC can be determined by any convenient assay technique for quantification of copy numbers, as is known in the art. Examples of suitable assays include, but are not limited to, Real Time (TaqMan&#xae;) PCR (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) and Invader&#xae; (Third Wave Technologies, Madison, Wis.) assays. Preferably, such assays are developed in such a way that the amplification efficiency of both the IC and GOI sequences are equal or very similar. For example, in a Real Time TaqMan&#xae; PCR assay, the signal from a single-copy GOI (the source cell is determined to be heterozygous for the GOI) will be detected one amplification cycle later than the signal from a two-copy IC, because the amount of the GOI is half that of the IC. For the same heterozygous sample, an Invader&#xae; assay would measure a GOI/IC ratio of about 1:2 or 0.5. For a sample that is homozygous for both the GOI and the IC, the GOI signal would be detected at the same time as the IC signal (TaqMan&#xae;), and the Invader assay would measure a GOI/IC ratio of about 2:2 or 1.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0116\" num=\"0115\">These guidelines apply to any polyploid cell, or to haploid cells (such as pollen cells), since the copy number of the GOI or of the IC remain proportional to the genome copy number (or ploidy level) of the cell. Thus, these zygosity assays can be performed on triploid tissues such as corn endosperm.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">1. Field</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">The present invention relates generally to air carts and air seeding equipment. More specifically, embodiments of the present invention concern an air cart with a metering assembly that includes independently powered metering wheels in a common meter body.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">2. Discussion of Prior Art</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">It is well known by those of skill in the art that agricultural air carts and air seeding equipment are used to discharge seed and/or fertilizer in a field. In general, an air cart with one or more product tanks (to carry seed and/or fertilizer) is advanced along the field with an air seeding implement having a series of ground-engaging openers. The air cart meters a flow of seed and/or a flow of fertilizer to each opener through pressurized pneumatic conveying lines as the air cart and implement are being advanced. For each tank, the air cart includes a metering device with a series of metering wheels to dispense multiple flows of seed or fertilizer. The dispensed particulate flows are then carried by respective conveying lines to the openers.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">Some of the known metering devices have metering wheels on a common shaft so that the wheels rotate with each other at the same speed. Other known metering devices having metering wheels that can be engaged and disengaged independently of the other wheels (e.g., so that particulate flows can be selectively provided to the openers). Some known metering devices have metering wheels with a flow rate that can be adjusted independently of the other wheels.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">However, conventional air carts and metering devices have a number of deficiencies. For instance, metering devices with metering wheels on a common shaft are limited to discharging particulate flows at the same material flow rate. That is, such devices generally do not permit the metering wheels to be engaged, disengaged, or adjusted independently of the other wheels.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">Prior art metering devices with independent metering wheels are mechanically complex and prone to mechanical failure. For instance, these devices have a series of pressurized metering bodies that each contain a meter wheel to dispense a respective flow of granular material. Each meter wheel is driven by a dedicated transmission mounted outside of the meter body. The pressurized metering bodies of these known devices are prone to leakage of pressurized air, which can impact the operability of the air cart. Furthermore, the exposed transmissions experience harsh environmental conditions that exacerbate failure of transmission components.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0003\" level=\"1\">SUMMARY</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">The following brief summary is provided to indicate the nature of the subject matter disclosed herein. While certain aspects of the present invention are described below, the summary is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">Embodiments of the present invention provide an air cart that does not suffer from the problems and limitations of the prior art seeding equipment set forth above.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\">The present invention concerns a mobile air cart that broadly includes a tank configured to contain particulate, a pressurized air source, a plurality of pneumatic conveying lines, and a metering assembly. The pneumatic conveying lines are fluidly coupled to the pressurized air source, such that an air stream is provided within each conveying line. The metering assembly is configured to receive particulate from the tank and is coupled to the pneumatic conveying lines so as to deliver particulate thereto. The metering assembly broadly includes wall structure and a plurality of meter units. The wall structure defines a unitary, common metering chamber, an inlet through which particulate from the tank enters the common metering chamber, and an outlet through which metered particulate exits the common metering chamber and moves toward the conveying lines. The meter units are configured to meter and separate particulate within the common metering chamber into respective particulate flows corresponding to the conveying lines. Each of the meter units includes a rotatable metering wheel, with rotation of the metering wheel serving to meter the respective particulate flow. The meter units include independently controllable drives for powering the metering wheels, such that each metering wheel is selectively and individually rotatable. Each of the meter units includes a frame that projects into the common metering chamber. The frames support the metering wheels within the common metering chamber.</p>\n",

      "<heading id=\"h-0005\" level=\"1\">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0035\">Turning initially to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, an air cart <b>30</b> is configured to be drawn behind a self-propelled tractor (not shown) along with a planter (not shown) having a series of openers. As is customary, the air cart <b>30</b> supplies seed and/or fertilizer (in granular form) to the planter while the planter and air cart <b>30</b> are drawn across a field. The air cart <b>30</b> preferably includes, among other things, a rolling cart chassis <b>32</b>, tanks <b>34</b>, a pneumatic conveying system <b>36</b>, and metering assemblies <b>38</b>. As will be explained, each metering assembly <b>38</b> is preferably configured to meter corresponding particulate flows F independently of one another (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 13 and 15</figref>).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0037\" num=\"0036\">The illustrated air cart <b>30</b> preferably includes four (4) product tanks <b>34</b> mounted on the cart chassis <b>32</b>. Each tank <b>34</b> is operable to contain a particulate material (generally, seed or granular fertilizer) for distribution to the planter. Each of the tanks <b>34</b> is sealed and pressurized by the conveying system <b>36</b> during use of the air cart <b>30</b>. Each tank <b>34</b> presents a lowermost tank outlet (not shown) that fluidly communicates with a corresponding metering assembly <b>38</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\">Turning to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the conveying system <b>36</b> is operable to collect seed and/or fertilizer from the tanks <b>34</b>, via the metering assemblies <b>38</b>, and convey the particulate material to the planter with multiple pressurized air streams. The illustrated conveying system <b>36</b> includes upper and lower collector modules <b>40</b>,<b>42</b> and upper and lower pneumatic conveying lines <b>44</b>,<b>46</b>. The upper and lower conveying lines <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> transmit corresponding upper and lower pressurized air streams <b>48</b>,<b>50</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\">In the usual manner, the upper collector modules <b>40</b> are fluidly connected to one another by upper conveying lines <b>44</b>. Similarly, the lower collector modules <b>42</b> are fluidly connected to one another by lower conveying lines <b>46</b>. The illustrated air cart embodiment includes ten (10) upper conveying lines <b>44</b> and ten (10) lower conveying lines <b>46</b>. However, the air cart <b>30</b> could have an alternative number of conveying lines <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> (e.g., depending on the configuration of the metering assembly <b>38</b> or the number of openers associated with the planter).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\">Turning to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2<i>a</i></figref>, the upper collector module <b>40</b> preferably presents a series of upper module compartments <b>40</b><i>a </i>that are each sealed from one another and separated by corresponding partitions <b>51</b>. The upper module compartments <b>40</b><i>a </i>fluidly communicate with corresponding ones of the upper conveying lines <b>44</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\">Similarly, the lower collector module <b>42</b> preferably presents a series of lower module compartments <b>42</b><i>a </i>that are each sealed from one another and separated by corresponding partitions <b>51</b>. The lower module compartments <b>42</b><i>a </i>fluidly communicate with corresponding ones of the lower conveying lines <b>46</b>. The lower module compartments <b>42</b><i>a </i>fluidly communicate with corresponding ones of the upper module compartments <b>40</b><i>a</i>. Additional details of the module compartments are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,915,200, issued Dec. 23, 2014, entitled SEEDER WITH METERING SYSTEM HAVING SELECTIVELY POWERED METERING SECTIONS, which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\">The collector modules <b>40</b>,<b>42</b> fluidly communicate with a corresponding metering assembly <b>38</b> to receive flows F of granular material from the metering assembly <b>38</b>. The upper module compartments <b>40</b><i>a </i>of the upper module <b>40</b> fluidly communicate with upper conveying lines <b>44</b> to discharge granular material to the upper conveying lines <b>44</b>. Similarly, the lower module compartments <b>42</b><i>a </i>of the lower modules <b>42</b> fluidly communicate with lower conveying lines <b>46</b> to discharge granular material to the lower conveying lines <b>46</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\">In the illustrated embodiment, the collector modules <b>40</b>,<b>42</b> present a series often (10) module compartments <b>40</b><i>a</i>,<b>42</b><i>a</i>, respectively. However, the collector modules <b>40</b>,<b>42</b> could have an alternative number of compartments <b>40</b><i>a</i>,<b>42</b><i>a </i>(e.g., depending on the configuration of the metering assembly <b>38</b> or the number of openers associated with the planter).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\">The conveying system <b>36</b> also preferably includes a series of diverter valves <b>52</b> installed in the upper collector module <b>40</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>). Each diverter valve <b>52</b> is swingable between discrete positions to selectively control whether the respective particulate flow F is discharged into the corresponding upper conveying line <b>44</b>, the corresponding lower conveying line <b>46</b>, or both. Additional features of the diverter valves <b>52</b> and their operation are disclosed in the above-incorporated '200 patent.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0044\">Turning again to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, the illustrated conveying system <b>36</b> also includes a pair of powered fans <b>53</b> and upper and lower manifolds <b>54</b>. Each fan <b>53</b> provides a pressurized air source that distributes pressurized air to one of the manifolds <b>54</b>. It will be understood that an alternative fan configuration could provide pressurized air to manifolds <b>54</b> without departing from the principles of the present invention. For instance, the air cart could have a single fan that provides pressurized air to both manifolds <b>54</b>. The upper manifold <b>54</b> is fluidly coupled to upper conveying lines <b>44</b> to discharge pressurized air streams <b>48</b> therein. Similarly, lower manifold <b>54</b> is fluidly coupled to lower conveying lines <b>46</b> to discharge pressurized air streams <b>50</b> therein.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0045\">In the usual manner, the air streams <b>48</b>,<b>50</b> carry granular material through the conveying lines <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> and to a series of openers (not shown) associated with the planter. It will be appreciated that pressurized air from the air streams <b>48</b>,<b>50</b> also pressurizes the tanks <b>34</b> and the metering assembly <b>38</b>. However, because the tanks <b>34</b> and the metering assembly <b>38</b> are both preferably sealed, air from the air streams <b>48</b>,<b>50</b> is restricted from leaking out of the tanks <b>34</b> and the metering assembly <b>38</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0046\">Turning to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4-15</figref>, the metering assembly <b>38</b> is operable to receive a supply of particulate material from the corresponding tank <b>34</b> and provide separate particulate flows F (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 13 and 15</figref>) that are discharged to the respective conveying lines <b>44</b>,<b>46</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\">As will be discussed, the metering assembly <b>38</b> includes meter units <b>56</b> that are installed in a common meter body <b>58</b> and are operable independently of one another to meter corresponding particulate flows F. That is, the meter units <b>56</b> are independently operable so that the flow rate of each particulate flow F can be controlled independently of the other particulate flows F. Each particulate flow F can be independently turned on and turned off More preferably, the flow rate of each particulate flow F can be independently varied. The metering assembly <b>38</b> broadly includes the meter body <b>58</b>, meter units <b>56</b>, and a particulate plate <b>60</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 13-15</figref>).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\">Turning to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4-10</figref>, the meter body <b>58</b> preferably provides a sealed wall structure that can be pressurized during air cart operation. The meter body <b>58</b> preferably presents a unitary chamber <b>62</b> that receives the meter units <b>56</b>. In particular, the illustrated meter body <b>58</b> preferably includes a rear wall <b>64</b>, side walls <b>66</b>, inner front wall <b>68</b>, outer front wall <b>70</b>, and removable upper and lower walls <b>72</b><i>a,b </i>(see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 7-9</figref>).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0049\">The outer front wall <b>70</b> preferably presents upper and lower access openings <b>70</b><i>a,b </i>(see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>) which are preferably sealed closed by corresponding walls <b>72</b><i>a,b </i>(see FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>9</b>). The removable walls <b>72</b><i>a,b </i>comprise doors that are selectively removable from the outer front wall <b>70</b> to permit access to the chamber <b>62</b> via the openings <b>70</b><i>a,b. </i></p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0050\">The walls cooperatively form the chamber <b>62</b>, which is configured to be pressurized by the conveying system <b>36</b> to a gauge pressure above ambient pressure. Preferably, the walls are sealingly interconnected to restrict leakage of pressurized air from the chamber <b>62</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0052\" num=\"0051\">Again referring to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4-10</figref>, the walls <b>64</b>,<b>66</b>,<b>68</b>,<b>70</b>,<b>72</b> cooperatively define an inlet <b>74</b><i>a </i>and outlet <b>74</b><i>b </i>of the meter body <b>58</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref>). The wall structure also preferably defines the unitary chamber <b>62</b>. The chamber <b>62</b> includes a particulate supply section <b>76</b><i>a </i>and an air flow section <b>76</b><i>b </i>that are separated by the inner front wall <b>68</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref>). The air flow section <b>76</b><i>b </i>fluidly communicates with a top of the corresponding tank <b>34</b> via a pressure hose (not shown). The hose is configured to transfer air between the tank <b>34</b> and the air flow section <b>76</b><i>b </i>to equalize air pressure therebetween.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0053\" num=\"0052\">As will be described, the meter body <b>58</b> is configured to receive a series of meter units <b>56</b> within the chamber <b>62</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the meter body <b>58</b> presents a series of ten (10) meter stations <b>77</b>, all positioned laterally with the chamber <b>62</b> along the length of the meter body <b>58</b> and each configured to receive a meter unit <b>56</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>). However, the meter body <b>58</b> could present an alternative number of meter stations <b>77</b>. The meter body <b>58</b> also preferably includes partitions <b>78</b> that define outlet passages <b>80</b> spaced along the length of the outlet <b>74</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 5, 6, and 9</figref>). Each outlet passage <b>80</b> is preferably laterally aligned with, and in fluid communication with, a corresponding upper module compartment <b>40</b><i>a </i>and a corresponding lower module compartment <b>42</b><i>a </i>of the collector modules <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0054\" num=\"0053\">Preferably, the chamber <b>62</b> further includes meter chamber sections <b>82</b> that communicate with the supply section <b>76</b><i>a </i>and with corresponding outlet passages <b>80</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 10-12</figref>). As will be explained, the illustrated chamber sections <b>82</b> are defined by meter units <b>56</b> and the particulate plate <b>60</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0055\" num=\"0054\">Turning to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4, 8, 9, and 15</figref>, the illustrated particulate plate <b>60</b> includes opposite upper and lower side margins <b>84</b><i>a,b </i>and a guide surface <b>86</b> that extends vertically between the side margins <b>84</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref>). For purposes which will be described, the guide surface <b>86</b> includes a curved portion. The guide surface <b>86</b> defines a plurality of ridges <b>90</b> that are spaced along the length of the guide surface <b>86</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0056\" num=\"0055\">The upper side margin <b>84</b><i>a </i>of the particulate plate <b>60</b> presents a slot <b>92</b> that extends lengthwise along the particulate plate <b>60</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref>). The particulate plate <b>60</b> is removably mounted on a rod <b>94</b> of the meter body <b>58</b> and is operable to be swung into and out of the operating position along the meter units <b>56</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15</figref>). As will be explained, the particulate plate <b>60</b> cooperates with each meter unit <b>56</b> in the operating position (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15</figref>) to define a path along which the particulate material moves through the corresponding chamber section <b>82</b>. The particulate plate <b>60</b> can be swung away from the meter units <b>56</b> (e.g., to permit access to meter wheels and removal of the particulate plate <b>60</b> from the meter body <b>58</b>).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0057\" num=\"0056\">The illustrated metering assembly <b>38</b> preferably has a single particulate plate <b>60</b> that extends across multiple chamber sections <b>82</b>. However, as will be discussed, certain aspects of the present invention contemplate a metering assembly having a plurality of discrete particulate plates, each corresponding with a respective metering unit.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0058\" num=\"0057\">Turning to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 15-19</figref>, meter units <b>56</b> are preferably located in the chamber <b>62</b> and are operable independently of each other to meter corresponding particulate flows F. Each of the illustrated meter units <b>56</b> includes, among other things, a frame <b>96</b>, a meter wheel <b>98</b>, and a meter drive <b>100</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0059\" num=\"0058\">The frames <b>96</b> are mounted on the meter body <b>58</b> to project into the chamber <b>62</b>. The frames <b>92</b> are positioned in series, and cooperate generally with the plate <b>60</b> to define the spaced apart chamber sections <b>82</b>. Each particulate flow F is generated within a corresponding chamber section <b>82</b> and then discharged into the respective outlet passage <b>80</b>. Each frame <b>96</b> is configured to rotatably support the meter wheel <b>98</b> within a corresponding chamber section <b>82</b>. That is to say, the frames project into the common chamber <b>62</b> so that preferably all the meter wheels are supported in the same, common chamber <b>62</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0059\">The frame <b>96</b> preferably includes an L-shaped bracket <b>102</b>, wear plates <b>104</b>, a cover <b>106</b>, and a spacer <b>108</b> that are removably fastened to one another. The bracket <b>102</b> includes a bracket base <b>110</b> and bracket arm <b>112</b> that are integrally formed. As will be discussed, the bracket arm <b>112</b> supports the meter wheel <b>98</b> relative to the meter body <b>58</b>. The bracket <b>102</b> also includes studs <b>113</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref>) fixed to the bracket base <b>110</b>. Furthermore, the frame <b>96</b> presents an interior transmission compartment <b>114</b> formed by cavities <b>116</b><i>a,b </i>that communicate with one another and operably receive part of the illustrated meter drive <b>100</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref>).

      "<p id=\"p-0061\" num=\"0060\">The cover <b>106</b> is removably attached to the bracket <b>102</b> to enclose the cavities <b>116</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18</figref>). Preferably, the cover <b>106</b> is in sealing engagement with the bracket arm <b>112</b> when secured thereto so that the drive components within the frame <b>96</b> are covered. The sealing engagement restricts the compartment <b>114</b> and drive components from being contaminated by dust or other particles from the chamber <b>62</b>. It is also within the ambit of the present invention for the frame to be alternatively shaped (e.g., to house alternative transmission components of the meter drive, have an open construction such that the transmission components are exposed, etc.).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0062\" num=\"0061\">The spacer <b>108</b> generally directs particulate downwardly into the chamber section <b>82</b> and toward the guide surface <b>86</b> as particulate is advanced through the chamber section <b>82</b> by the meter wheel <b>98</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15</figref>). The spacer <b>108</b> presents a concave guide surface <b>118</b> and opposite end surfaces <b>120</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 17</figref>). The spacer <b>108</b> is removably attached to the bracket base <b>110</b> with fasteners (not shown).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0063\" num=\"0062\">Although the structure of the illustrated frames <b>96</b> is preferred, the metering assembly <b>38</b> could include an alternative frame construction without departing from the scope of the present invention.

      "<p id=\"p-0066\" num=\"0065\">Turning again to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 15-19</figref>, the illustrated frames <b>96</b> are removably secured to the rear wall <b>64</b> and are located within the chamber <b>62</b> to project in a fore-and-aft direction (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15</figref>). In particular, the meter unit <b>56</b> includes an adapter <b>122</b> used to mount the frame <b>96</b> on the rear wall <b>64</b>. The illustrated adapter <b>122</b> includes spaced adapter flanges <b>124</b><i>a,b </i>and a sleeve <b>126</b> that interconnects the flanges <b>124</b> to provide a unitary structure (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref>).

The illustrated motor <b>128</b> includes a motor flange <b>130</b> that is removably mounted on the adapter flange <b>124</b><i>b </i>with fasteners.

      "<p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0069\">Turning to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref>, each meter drive <b>100</b> preferably includes the motor <b>128</b> and a transmission <b>132</b> to selectively power one of the meter wheels <b>98</b>. The motor <b>128</b> preferably drives a corresponding one of the meter units <b>56</b> and permits each meter unit <b>56</b> to be controlled independently of the other meter units <b>56</b>. The motor <b>128</b> preferably comprises a variable-speed electric motor that includes a rotating motor shaft <b>134</b>. The motor <b>128</b> is drivingly attached to the transmission <b>132</b> with a conventional shaft coupler <b>136</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref>).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0070\">When the motor <b>128</b> is on, the motor <b>128</b> causes one of the meter wheels <b>98</b> to rotate so that the meter wheel <b>98</b> generates the respective particulate flow F. When the motor is turned off, the motor <b>128</b> restricts rotation of the meter wheel <b>98</b> and prevents the flow of particulate material through the respective chamber section <b>82</b>. Furthermore, the motor speed of the motor <b>128</b> could be varied to adjust the flow rate of particulate material through the chamber section <b>82</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0071\">While the illustrated motor <b>128</b> is preferably a variable speed electric motor, the metering assembly <b>38</b> could use an alternative motor (such as a single-speed electric motor, a hydraulic motor, etc.) without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0072\">Furthermore, although each of the meter units <b>56</b> is preferably powered by a corresponding motor <b>128</b>, the units <b>56</b> (or a set of the units) could alternatively be driven by a common drive mechanism. For instance, multiple units <b>56</b> could be powered by a common shaft (not shown), e.g., a shaft powered by a motor or by a ground travel drive mechanism (which is powered by air cart travel across the ground). For multiple units <b>56</b> driven by a common shaft, the meter drive <b>100</b> of each meter unit <b>56</b> also preferably includes a clutch (also not shown) to selectively power the meter unit <b>56</b> with the common shaft.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0073\">Turning again to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 15-19</figref>, the meter wheel <b>98</b> is configured to meter particulate flow through a respective chamber section <b>82</b> and thereby generate a corresponding one of the particulate flows F. The illustrated meter wheel <b>98</b> is unitary and presents an axial bore <b>138</b> and a key <b>140</b> that extends along the bore <b>138</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 17</figref>).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0074\">The meter wheel <b>98</b> also preferably includes a series of blades <b>142</b> that are defined by flutes <b>144</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>). Each flute <b>144</b> forms a pocket <b>146</b> to receive particulate (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>). Each blade <b>142</b> is separated from adjacent blades by corresponding flutes <b>144</b>. The illustrated blades <b>142</b> and flutes <b>144</b> are preferably helically shaped. However, the blades <b>142</b> and/or flutes <b>144</b> could have an alternative shape. For instance, the blades <b>142</b> and flutes <b>144</b> could extend parallel to the rotating axis of the wheel <b>98</b>. Also, the wheel <b>98</b> could have flutes <b>144</b> arranged in a herringbone pattern (or another alternative pattern) or could be devoid of flutes <b>144</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0076\" num=\"0075\">As will be explained, each meter wheel <b>98</b> cooperates with the particulate plate <b>60</b> cooperates to generate a particulate flow F through a respective chamber section <b>82</b> of the metering assembly <b>38</b>.</p>\n",

The transmission <b>132</b> preferably permits rotation of the meter wheel <b>98</b> independently of the other wheels <b>98</b>. The illustrated transmission <b>132</b> comprises a worm drive that includes an input shaft <b>148</b>, a worm <b>150</b>, a driven gear <b>152</b>, and an output shaft <b>154</b>. However, as will be described, the transmission <b>132</b> could take alternative forms without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0078\" num=\"0077\">Turning back to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 15-19</figref>, the output shaft <b>154</b> is unitary and presents a slot <b>156</b> that receives the key <b>140</b> of the meter wheel <b>98</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18</figref>). The output shaft <b>154</b> is rotatably supported by the bracket <b>102</b>, with only one end of the output shaft <b>154</b> being rotatably supported on the bracket <b>102</b>. However, the bracket <b>102</b> could be configured to rotatably receive and support both ends of the output shaft <b>154</b> without departing from the ambit of the present invention.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0079\" num=\"0078\">The output shaft <b>154</b> is rotatably mounted on the arm <b>112</b> and extends into and out of the compartment <b>114</b>. The output shaft <b>154</b> is preferably in rotating sealing engagement with the bracket arm <b>112</b> to restrict the compartment <b>114</b> from fluidly communicating with the chamber <b>62</b>. In this manner, the sealing engagement restricts the compartment <b>114</b> from being contaminated by dust or other particles from the chamber <b>62</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0080\" num=\"0079\">The driven gear <b>152</b> and the meter wheel <b>98</b> are both mounted on the output shaft <b>154</b> and rotate therewith about a lateral axis (not shown).

      "<p id=\"p-0081\" num=\"0080\">The input shaft <b>148</b> is elongated and extends into and out of the compartment <b>114</b>. The input shaft <b>148</b> presents opposite ends that are rotatably supported by respective bearings <b>158</b>,<b>160</b> so that the input shaft <b>148</b> is rotatably mounted (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref>).

      "<p id=\"p-0082\" num=\"0081\">The worm <b>150</b> is fixed (fixedly connected or formed integrally therewith) on the input shaft <b>148</b> and rotates therewith. In the usual manner, the worm <b>150</b> is positioned in driving engagement with the driven gear <b>152</b>. Consequently, rotation of the input shaft <b>148</b> and the worm <b>150</b> causes corresponding rotation of the driven gear <b>152</b> and the output shaft <b>154</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0083\" num=\"0082\">While the illustrated meter drive <b>100</b> is preferred, it is also within the ambit of the present invention where the meter unit <b>56</b> includes an alternative drive to rotate the wheel <b>98</b>. In one preferred alternative embodiment, an alternative transmission could include a cogged timing belt, a cogged driven sheave, and a cogged drive sheave to drive the wheel <b>98</b>. For this alternative timing belt transmission, the driven sheave is mounted on the output shaft <b>154</b> in place of the driven gear <b>152</b>. The drive sheave is mounted on a drive shaft (not shown) to rotate therewith. The drive shaft is located adjacent the motor <b>128</b> and is generally parallel to the output shaft <b>154</b>. An external driven gear is mounted externally to the frame on the drive shaft and rotates therewith.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0084\" num=\"0083\">Also for this timing belt embodiment, the frame is sized to enclose the sheaves and the timing belt. The frame is in sealing engagement with the meter body <b>58</b> and extends through the meter body <b>58</b> so that the drive shaft is located outside of the meter body <b>58</b>. As a result, the external driven gear is also outside of the meter body.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0085\" num=\"0084\">The driven gear is drivingly connected to the motor <b>128</b> by a conventional right angle gear drive (not shown) and an external drive gear powered by the right angle gear drive. The external drive gear is external to the frame and the meter body <b>58</b> and is positioned in intermeshing engagement with the external driven gear.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0086\" num=\"0085\">In another preferred alternative embodiment of the timing belt transmission, the drive sheaves of the meter units <b>56</b> are selectively driven by a common shaft (not shown) that extends laterally and is generally parallel to the driven shaft. As will be appreciated, the common shaft can be powered by a motor or by a ground travel drive mechanism powered by air cart travel across the ground. The drive preferably includes a clutch that permits an external drive gear to be selectively powered by the common shaft. The external drive gear is positioned in intermeshing engagement with the external driven gear.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0087\" num=\"0086\">It will also be appreciated that other alternative transmissions could be employed to drive the meter wheel <b>98</b>. For instance, an alternative transmission could include a chain-and-sprocket drive mechanism. Yet further, for some aspects of the present invention, the metering assembly <b>38</b> could be devoid of any transmission between the meter wheel <b>98</b> and a motor (or other preferred power source).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0088\" num=\"0087\">Turning to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 5, 6, and 10-15</figref>, the illustrated meter units <b>56</b> are installed and compactly arranged in corresponding meter stations <b>77</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>). The meter units <b>56</b> are preferably positioned alongside one another so that the meter wheels <b>98</b> are generally axially aligned with one another. That is, the meter wheels <b>98</b> generally rotate about the same laterally extending axis. However, for some aspects of the present invention, one or more meter wheels <b>98</b> could be axially offset from one another.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0089\" num=\"0088\">The illustrated metering assembly <b>38</b> includes six (6) meter units <b>56</b>, with three (3) meter units <b>56</b> located adjacent each side of the meter body <b>58</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>). Within the remaining central four (4) meter stations <b>77</b>, the metering assembly <b>38</b> preferably includes spacers <b>161</b> secured to the meter body <b>58</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>). The spacers <b>161</b> restrict particulate from flowing through the stations <b>77</b> and the corresponding outlet passages <b>80</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0090\" num=\"0089\">It will be appreciated that the metering assembly <b>38</b> could have an alternative number of meter units <b>56</b>. For instance, with particular respect to the illustrated embodiment, the number of meter units <b>56</b> in the meter body <b>58</b> could range from five (5) to ten (10) without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0091\" num=\"0090\">The illustrated meter units <b>56</b> have generally the same construction and are powered in the same manner. However, for certain aspects of the present invention, the air cart <b>30</b> could have different types of meter units as part of a single metering assembly. For example, a single metering assembly could have meter units powered by different types of power sources. Also, a single metering assembly could have meter units with different frame constructions, different transmissions, or different meter wheel configurations. That is to say, according to certain aspects of the present invention, the meter units of a given metering assembly need not be identical. In fact, according to some principles of the present invention, the metering assembly may not have all the meter units associated with a single, common chamber (e.g., the metering assembly might alternatively have bifurcated chambers adjacent each side of the machine). However, it is important for purposes of the present invention that the metering assembly have a sealed chamber in which multiple ones of the metering wheels operate such that multiple particulate flows are generated from each chamber.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0092\" num=\"0091\">Again, the preferred particulate plate <b>60</b> operably engages all of the meter units <b>56</b> in the operating position (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15</figref>). The axial alignment of the meter wheels <b>98</b> is preferred so that the same guide surface <b>86</b> cooperates with multiple meter wheels <b>98</b> (in the illustrated embodiment, the same guide surface <b>86</b> cooperates with all of the meter wheels <b>98</b>).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0093\" num=\"0092\">In the operating position, the particulate plate <b>60</b> cooperates with the meter wheels <b>98</b> to direct particulate flows F through chamber sections <b>82</b> of the metering assembly <b>38</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15</figref>). More specifically, the guide surface <b>86</b> cooperates with the pockets <b>146</b> of the meter wheel <b>98</b> to capture particulate material. As the wheel <b>98</b> and the pockets <b>146</b> rotate in the indicated direction (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15</figref>), the meter wheel <b>98</b> moves particulate material along the guide surface <b>86</b> from an intake opening <b>162</b> to a discharge opening <b>164</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15</figref>).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0094\" num=\"0093\">To enable a compact arrangement of meter units <b>56</b>, the illustrated frames <b>96</b> are preferably compactly positioned in series along the length of the chamber <b>62</b>. More particularly, the frames <b>96</b> are all preferably mounted on the rear wall <b>64</b> in an end-to-end configuration where the bracket bases <b>110</b> are located end-to-end and are aligned with one another (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>). Also, the brackets <b>102</b> are oriented so that each pair of adjacent bracket arms <b>112</b> is spaced apart from each other.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0095\" num=\"0094\">However, the frames <b>96</b> could be alternatively arranged without departing from the scope of the present invention. For instance, one or more pairs of adjacent brackets <b>102</b> could be oriented in a mirrored configuration where the bracket arms <b>112</b> of the bracket pair are located next to each other by inverting one bracket <b>102</b> of the pair relative to the other bracket <b>102</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0096\" num=\"0095\">Preferably, when the particulate plate <b>60</b> is in the operating position, each adjacent pair of frames <b>96</b> cooperate with the particulate plate <b>60</b> to form one of the chamber sections <b>82</b> and to also define the intake opening <b>162</b> and the discharge opening <b>164</b> that communicate with the chamber section <b>82</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0097\" num=\"0096\">Again, the guide surface <b>86</b> defines ridges <b>90</b> that are spaced along the length of the particulate plate <b>60</b>. The ridges <b>90</b> are positioned and configured to engage the corresponding bracket arms <b>112</b> in the operating position.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0098\" num=\"0097\">The particulate plate <b>60</b> is rotatably supported by the rod <b>94</b> and can be swung into and out of the operating position. The particulate plate <b>60</b> can be swung out of the operating position (in a direction away from the meter units <b>56</b>) for various purposes (e.g., to permit user access to the meter wheels <b>98</b> or removal of the particulate plate <b>60</b> from the meter body <b>58</b>). The particulate plate <b>60</b> can also be swung into the operating position and secured with fasteners (not shown). When in the operating position, the lower side margin <b>84</b><i>b </i>of the particulate plate <b>60</b> engages a shoulder <b>166</b> of each bracket arm <b>112</b> to restrict swinging of the particulate plate <b>60</b> toward the meter units <b>56</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>). Also in the operating position, the curved portion of the guide surface <b>86</b> conforms to a rounded end surface <b>168</b> presented by the bracket arm <b>112</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0099\" num=\"0098\">The illustrated particulate plate <b>60</b> has a single operating position that is not adjustable. To accommodate different types (e.g., sizes) of particulate material and different particulate flow rates, the particulate plate <b>60</b> is preferably replaced with one of several different plates (not shown) having a different guide surfaces. For instance, when in the operating position, the plates could be configured so that the different guide surfaces are spaced from the frames <b>96</b> at corresponding dimensions that are different from each other.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0100\" num=\"0099\">However, it is within the scope of the present invention where the particulate plate can be adjustably secured (e.g., with fasteners) among a series of operating positions. Such adjustment of the plate among operating positions can permit the same plate to accommodate different particulates and different particulate flow rates.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0101\" num=\"0100\">The illustrated metering assembly <b>38</b> preferably has a single particulate plate <b>60</b> that is sized and configured to extend along and engage all of the meter units <b>56</b>. However, it is within the scope of the present invention where the metering assembly <b>38</b> includes an alternative particulate plate construction to engage the meter units <b>56</b>. For example, certain aspects of the present invention contemplate a metering assembly having multiple particulate plates that each engage a corresponding series or one of meter units <b>56</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0102\" num=\"0101\">The chamber sections <b>82</b> are configured to operably receive meter wheels <b>98</b>. Each meter wheel <b>98</b> is rotatably mounted in a corresponding chamber section <b>82</b> to, with the other components (e.g., the adjacent frames <b>96</b> and plate <b>60</b>), generate a flow F of particulate from the intake opening <b>162</b> to the discharge opening <b>164</b>. The chamber sections <b>82</b> are configured to receive and permit the particulate flow F to be advanced therethrough as the meter wheel <b>98</b> rotates.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0103\" num=\"0102\">Again, the illustrated chamber sections <b>82</b> are each cooperatively defined by an adjacent pair of frames <b>96</b> and the particulate plate <b>60</b>. As a result, each chamber section <b>82</b> is separated (at least with respect to particulate flow) from an adjacent chamber section <b>82</b> by a corresponding bracket arm <b>112</b> that extends between the chamber sections <b>82</b>, although it is important to note that the chamber sections <b>82</b> are all still part of the same overall common chamber <b>62</b> and are fluidly intercommunicated.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0104\" num=\"0103\">However, it is within the ambit of the present invention where alternative structure extends between and separates the chamber sections <b>82</b> from each other. For instance, the assembly <b>30</b> could include partitions separate from the frames <b>96</b> to extend between adjacent chamber sections <b>82</b>. Again, it is important for the partitions to only divide the common sealed chamber <b>62</b> into fluidly intercommunicated parts, each of which is associated with a respective particulate flow, with all the meter units <b>56</b> (including the partitions) being housed in the common meter body.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0105\" num=\"0104\">In operation, the air cart <b>30</b> is advanced along a field and discharges seed and/or fertilizer to openers (not shown) of a seeder implement. The conveying system <b>36</b> is powered during operation to carry seed and/or fertilizer forwardly along the conveying lines <b>44</b>,<b>46</b> toward the openers.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0106\" num=\"0105\">Each metering assembly <b>38</b> meters particulate from the corresponding tank <b>34</b> and discharges the metered particulate as particulate flows F into the collector modules <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>. The collector modules <b>40</b>,<b>42</b> selectively divert the metered particulate flows F into corresponding conveying lines <b>44</b>,<b>46</b>. As discussed above, the air streams <b>48</b>,<b>50</b> collect the particulate flows F and carry them forwardly.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0002\" num=\"0001\">Example embodiments are related to systems for monitoring seeds and methods of monitoring the seeds. Such methods and systems may be used in agricultural seeders and planters, for example.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0002\" level=\"1\">BACKGROUND</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">Advances in agricultural seeding machinery have made it possible to seed large swaths of farmland with each pass of a seeding machine. Air seeders typically include a dry holding tank for maintaining seeding material and a hose with applicator for applying the seeding material into furrows or blowing seeding material onto the surface of a prepared field. Modern air seeders may further include controls that allow the operator to configure the machine. Further, air seeders may allow simultaneous application of seed, fertilizers, and any other material useful in ensuring rapid germination and healthy growth cycle.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">Optical monitoring systems can detect and count the number of seeds dispensed or planted by the seeder, or the planting density of the seeds, for each row of the planter or the entire planter.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0003\" level=\"1\">SUMMARY</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">Exposure of optical monitoring systems to contaminants such as dust, dirt, debris and organic material from the seed and environment, can degrade the system performance. In field operation, a layer of dust accumulates on the optical windows of certain prior art sensing systems causing light from emitters to be refracted in unpredictable directions such that seed counts are duplicated or undetected.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">At least some example embodiments disclose a seed counting system having a plurality of light receivers. The light receivers are arranged such that if a performance of one of the light receivers is degraded by dust or debris, at least one other light receiver compensates to avoid inaccuracies in a seed count or seed density.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">At least some example embodiments disclose a seed counting system having three parallel channels of signal conditioning. Each of the channels has a selected gain and bandwidth associated with a seed type.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">At least another example embodiment discloses a seed counting system including a light source configured to emit light along a plane of an interior of a seed tube, a plurality of light receivers around the plane of the interior of the seed tube, each of the plurality of light receivers configured to receive light in at least two sectors of a plurality of sectors of the plane and generate a sensing signal corresponding to the received light, a processing system including a plurality of conditioning channels, the processing system configured to process the sensing signals to generate conditioned signals and a controller configured to generate a seed count value based on the generated conditioned signals.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">At least another example embodiment discloses a method of monitoring seeds. The method includes emitting light, by a light source, along a plane of an interior of a seed tube, receiving light, by a plurality of light receivers, in at least two sectors of a plurality of sectors of the plane and generating a sensing signal corresponding to the received light, processing the sensing signals to generate conditioned signals and generating a seed count value based on the generated conditioned signals.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0022\" num=\"0021\">Various example embodiments will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings in which some example embodiments are illustrated.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0023\" num=\"0022\">Accordingly, while example embodiments are capable of various modifications and alternative forms, embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that there is no intent to limit example embodiments to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, example embodiments are to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the scope of the claims. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout the description of the figures.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0024\" num=\"0023\">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first element could be termed a second element, and, similarly, a second element could be termed a first element, without departing from the scope of example embodiments. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0025\" num=\"0024\">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled&#x201d; to another element, there are no intervening elements present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., &#x201c;between&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly between,&#x201d; &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly adjacent,&#x201d; etc.).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0026\" num=\"0025\">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of example embodiments. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;includes&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;including,&#x201d; when used herein, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components and/or groups thereof.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0027\" num=\"0026\">It should also be noted that in some alternative implementations, the functions/acts noted may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two figures shown in succession may in fact be executed substantially concurrently or may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality/acts involved.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0028\" num=\"0027\">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which example embodiments belong. It will be further understood that terms, e.g., those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0029\" num=\"0028\">Portions of example embodiments and corresponding detailed description are presented in terms a processor specifically programmed to execute software, or algorithms and symbolic representations of operation on data bits within a computer memory. These descriptions and representations are the ones by which those of ordinary skill in the art effectively convey the substance of their work to others of ordinary skill in the art. An algorithm, as the term is used here, and as it is used generally, is conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of optical, electrical, or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0030\" num=\"0029\">In the following description, illustrative embodiments will be described with reference to acts and symbolic representations of operations (e.g., in the form of flowcharts) that may be implemented as program modules or functional processes including routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc., that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types and may be implemented using existing hardware. Such existing hardware may include one or more Central Processing Units (CPUs), digital signal processors (DSPs), application-specific-integrated-circuits, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) computers or the like.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0031\" num=\"0030\">It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise, or as is apparent from the discussion, terms such as &#x201c;processing&#x201d; or &#x201c;computing&#x201d; or &#x201c;calculating&#x201d; or &#x201c;determining&#x201d; or &#x201c;displaying&#x201d; or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical, electronic quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0032\" num=\"0031\">Note also that the software implemented aspects of example embodiments are typically encoded on some form of tangible (or recording) storage medium or implemented over some type of transmission medium. The tangible storage medium may be magnetic (e.g., a floppy disk or a hard drive) or optical (e.g., a compact disk read only memory, or &#x201c;CD ROM&#x201d;), and may be read only or random access.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0033\" num=\"0032\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a side view of an air seeding machine including a seed monitoring system according to an example embodiment.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0034\" num=\"0033\">The illustration and description thereof is presented for explanation only and is not intended to limit the scope of example embodiment. Practitioners will appreciate that the disclosed monitoring system may be implemented as a component of any type of seeding machine, wherein seed product is dispersed onto/into a growing medium. In one embodiment, an existing seeding machine may be retrofitted with the disclosed seed monitoring system. In another embodiment, the hardware components for the disclosed seed monitoring system are implemented within a seeding machine during the manufacture process.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0035\" num=\"0034\">As shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, a seeder assembly <b>110</b> includes a holding tank <b>115</b> that holds varying quantities of seed material to be dispensed by an air seeding machine <b>105</b>.

      "<p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">Embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to turf maintenance vehicles and, more particularly, to an electronic controller operable to both control various vehicle subsystems based upon received inputs, and/or monitor and record vehicle operating and maintenance information.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0001\" level=\"1\">BACKGROUND</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">Turf maintenance vehicles such as lawn mowers, aerators, and spreader/sprayers are used by consumers and professional alike. These vehicles are typically configured as walk-behind or ride-on vehicles having an attached implement such as a grass cutting deck. Within the deck, cutting blades rotate at a speed sufficient to cut vegetation over which the deck passes during operation. The deck (e.g., cutting blades) may be powered by the engine via an implement drive system. A power take-off (PTO) is provided to allow the implement drive system to selectively engage with, and disengage from, the engine. That is, when the PTO is engaged, the engine may effectively power the implement drive system.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">Turf maintenance vehicles are known to use an electronic controller to monitor various engine and vehicle parameters. For example, the controller may monitor operator input regarding engine speed, and output commands to an electronic governor of the engine in response thereto. Such a speed control system is disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 9,002,585.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">To assist with maintenance, some vehicles also provide service indicators or reminders. Such reminders are usually presented based upon the expiration of a predetermined, fixed period of engine operation (the maintenance interval). These reminders may be presented to the operator when the maintenance task (e.g., engine oil change) is due and, once the task is completed, the reminder may be reset. The reminder is provided again at the expiration of subsequent maintenance intervals. Other reminders are not resettable and merely trigger at fixed intervals (e.g., every 100 hours).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">Still further, professional landscape contractors may work on multiple properties during a given day. In order to recover costs associated with each job, the operator may monitor engine and/or machine operation time, e.g. via an hour meter, for the duration of each job and record the same to a log. While effective, engine run time may not always reflect actual job cost. Moreover, the operator may not always remember to log hour meter readings between jobs.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0002\" level=\"1\">SUMMARY</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">Embodiments described herein may provide a turf maintenance vehicle controller, and associated methods, that may simplify vehicle operation and maintenance.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">For example, in one embodiment, a turf maintenance vehicle is provided that includes a chassis supported upon a ground surface by a plurality of ground-engaging members; a prime mover supported by the chassis, the prime mover having a drive shaft and an engine speed regulator; and an electronic controller (EC) in communication with the engine speed regulator. Also included is a prime mover speed selection switch in communication with the EC, wherein: actuation of the prime mover speed selection switch for a period of time less than a predetermined first threshold period causes the EC to command a speed of the prime mover to a first preset speed; actuation of the prime mover speed selection switch for a period of time equal to or greater than the first threshold period causes the EC to command the speed of the prime mover to a second preset speed different than the first preset speed; and actuation of the prime mover speed selection switch for a period of time equal to or greater than a predetermined second threshold period, the second threshold period being greater than the first threshold period, causes the EC to command the speed of the prime mover to a third preset speed different than the first and second preset speeds.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">In another embodiment, a method for controlling a turf maintenance vehicle is provided, wherein the method includes: actuating an engine speed selection switch from an off state to an on state; measuring an actuation time that the switch remains in the on state; and communicating the actuation time to an electronic controller (EC), the EC in communication with an engine of the vehicle. The method further includes: comparing, with the EC, the actuation time to a predetermined step interval; determining a number of expired step intervals occurring within the actuation time; and changing an engine speed command generated by the EC by a predetermined increment for each expired step interval.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">In yet another embodiment, a method for controlling a turf maintenance vehicle is provided, wherein the method includes: actuating an engine speed selection switch from an off state to an on state; communicating a signal to an electronic controller (EC) indicating that the engine speed selection switch is in the on state, the EC in communication with an engine of the vehicle; and generating a first engine speed command with the EC. The method further includes: measuring an actuation time that the engine speed selection switch remains in the on state; communicating the actuation time to the EC; comparing, with the EC, the actuation time to a predetermined step interval; and generating, with the EC, a revised engine speed command each time the actuation time exceeds a multiple of the step interval.</p>\n",

The vehicle further includes an implement connected to the chassis, the implement operatively connected to the prime mover when a power take-off (PTO) is engaged, and operatively disconnected from the prime mover when the PTO is disengaged, wherein the implement is adapted to perform a maintenance task. An electronic controller (EC) is provided and carried on the chassis. The EC includes a system memory and a property memory, wherein the system memory and the property memory each include a first storage portion adapted to record an accumulated time during which the PTO has been engaged. The property memory is resettable such that the first storage portion of the property memory is reset to a zero value, while the system memory is non-resettable.</p>\n",

Moreover, various structure/components, including but not limited to fasteners, electrical components (wiring, cables, etc.), and the like, may be shown diagrammatically or removed from some or all of the views to better illustrate aspects of the depicted embodiments, or where inclusion of such structure/components is not necessary to an understanding of the various exemplary embodiments described herein. The lack of illustration/description of such structure/components in a particular figure is, however, not to be interpreted as limiting the scope of the various embodiments in any way. Still further, &#x201c;Figure x&#x201d; and &#x201c;FIG. x&#x201d; may be used interchangeably herein to refer to the figure numbered &#x201c;x.&#x201d;</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0004\" level=\"1\">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0034\" num=\"0033\">In the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying figures of the drawing which form a part hereof. It is to be understood that other embodiments, which may not be described and/or illustrated herein, are certainly contemplated.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0035\" num=\"0034\">All headings and subheadings provided herein are for the convenience of the reader and should not be used to limit the meaning of any text that follows the heading, unless so specified. Moreover, unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities, and all terms expressing direction/orientation (e.g., vertical, horizontal, parallel, perpendicular, etc.) in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term &#x201c;about.&#x201d;</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0035\">Generally speaking, embodiments of the present disclosure may be directed to control systems for controlling various aspects of a power turf maintenance vehicle and, optionally, an attached or otherwise carried implement (e.g., a riding lawn mower). The control system may include an electronic controller (EC) adapted to control, based on detected operator inputs and sensed vehicle parameters, various functions of the vehicle and/or provide various information (e.g., maintenance data, property statistics) to an operator or technician through an interactive display (ID) in communication with the EC.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0037\" num=\"0036\">For example, the vehicle may include controls adapted to receive operator inputs that set an engine speed of the vehicle to any one of a plurality of discrete engine speeds (e.g., low engine speed, medium (e.g., efficient) engine speed, and maximum engine speed). The inputs may be received by the EC, which then, based on one or more monitored parameters, outputs a discrete command to an engine speed regulator, e.g., to an electronic governor or an electronic throttle actuator, adapted to control the engine speed. In some embodiments, one or more of the engine speed controls may be manipulated to provide a plurality of engine speed commands in addition to its primary command. For example, actuation of the low engine speed selection input for a period of time less than a predetermined threshold period may cause the EC to command the engine speed to a first preset speed. However, actuation of the low engine speed selection input for a period of time equal to or greater than the threshold period may cause the EC to command the engine speed to a second preset speed different (e.g., lower) than the first preset speed. In some embodiments, continued actuation of the low speed selection switch may cause the engine speed to step downwardly (e.g., in fixed increments) in proportion to the actuation time of the input until a minimum predetermined speed threshold is reached.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\">In other embodiments, the EC may include a first (e.g., system) memory and a second (e.g., property) memory. The system memory and the property memory may each include: a first storage portion adapted to record an accumulated time that a power take-off (PTO) has been engaged (wherein the EC is able to detect whether the PTO is engaged or disengaged); and, optionally, a second storage portion adapted to record an accumulated run time of the prime mover (which the EC is also able to detect/monitor). The property memory may be resettable such that the storage portions associated with the property memory are reset to a zero value, while the system memory is non-resettable. In addition to engine run time and PTO engaged time, at least the property memory may also track a volume of fuel (e.g., gasoline) used, e.g., since the property memory was last reset. Such a configuration may allow the operator of the vehicle to accurately track engine run time (as well as PTO engagement time and, optionally, fuel used) for a particular property. Moreover, in some embodiments, additional (and resettable) property memories may be included to allow the EC to store operating statistics for a plurality of properties.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\">While described herein as recording engine and PTO run time and fuel used, such a configuration is exemplary only. Other embodiments, may store other statistics to the system memory and/or the property memory. For example, engine and vehicle errors, fuel economy, maintenance information, and other vehicle information may be stored in the system memory (not-resettable), and/or in the property memory (resettable).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\">In still other embodiments, the EC may incorporate a maintenance monitor operable to track when one or more maintenance tasks is due (e.g., based upon elapsed run time of the engine or PTO engaged time). Upon completion of the maintenance task, the monitoring system may then permanently store, onboard the vehicle, information regarding: when the maintenance task was completed; and the accumulated run time of the engine (and/or accumulated PTO engagement time) at the time the maintenance task was completed. Moreover, the maintenance monitor may allow adjustment of future maintenance intervals based upon operator inputs regarding the maintenance task.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\">With reference to the figures of the drawing, wherein like reference numerals designate like parts and assemblies throughout the several views, <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a turf maintenance vehicle in accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure. While shown in this view as a self-propelled, turf maintenance vehicle, e.g., a zero-turning-radius riding lawn mower <b>100</b> (also referred to herein simply as a &#x201c;vehicle&#x201d; or &#x201c;mower&#x201d;), such a configuration is not limiting. That is, while embodiments are described herein with respect to a riding mower, those of skill in the art will realize that this disclosure is equally applicable to other types of mowers, as well as to other types of turf maintenance vehicles (e.g., aerators, spreader/sprayers, dethatchers, debris management systems (e.g., blowers, vacuums, sweeper, etc.), general purpose utility vehicles, and the like) without limitation.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\">It is noted that the term &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; (and variations thereof) does not have a limiting meaning where this terms appear in the accompanying description and claims. Further, &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; &#x201c;the,&#x201d; &#x201c;at least one,&#x201d; and &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein. Moreover, relative terms such as &#x201c;left,&#x201d; &#x201c;right,&#x201d; &#x201c;front,&#x201d; &#x201c;fore,&#x201d; &#x201c;forward,&#x201d; &#x201c;rear,&#x201d; &#x201c;aft,&#x201d; &#x201c;rearward,&#x201d; &#x201c;top,&#x201d; &#x201c;bottom,&#x201d; &#x201c;side,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;horizontal,&#x201d; &#x201c;vertical,&#x201d; and the like may be used herein and, if so, are from the perspective of one operating the mower <b>100</b> while the mower is in an operating configuration, e.g., while the mower <b>100</b> is positioned such that wheels <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> rest upon a generally horizontal ground surface <b>103</b> as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>. These terms are used only to simplify the description, however, and not to limit the interpretation of any embodiment described.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\">Still further, the suffixes &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;b&#x201d; may be used throughout this description to denote various left- and right-side parts/features, respectively. However, in most pertinent respects, the parts/features denoted with &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;b&#x201d; suffixes are substantially identical to, or mirror images of, one another. It is understood that, unless otherwise noted, the description of an individual part/feature (e.g., part/feature identified with an &#x201c;a&#x201d; suffix) also applies to the other part/feature (e.g., part/feature identified with a &#x201c;b&#x201d; suffix). Similarly, the description of a part/feature identified with no suffix may apply, unless noted otherwise, to both the corresponding left and right part/feature.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\">As shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, the mower <b>100</b> may include a frame or chassis <b>102</b> that supports a prime mover. While the prime mover may be configured as most any source of power (e.g., an electric motor), it is, in the embodiment shown, configured as an internal combustion engine <b>104</b>. The chassis <b>102</b> may be supported upon the ground surface <b>103</b> by ground-engaging members that, in one embodiment, include left and right ground-engaging drive wheels <b>106</b> that may be coupled to left and right sides of a rear portion of the mower <b>100</b> (e.g., only right drive wheel <b>106</b><i>b </i>visible, but left drive wheel is generally a mirror image). The drive wheels <b>106</b> may be independently powered by the engine (e.g., via one or more hydraulic motors, transmissions, transaxles, or the equivalent) so that the drive wheels <b>106</b> may rotate (relative to the chassis) and selectively propel the mower <b>100</b> over the ground surface <b>103</b>. While a single prime mover (e.g., engine <b>104</b>) may power both the vehicle wheels and the implement (cutting deck), other embodiments may utilize two or more prime movers (e.g., different prime movers for propulsion and for implement power) without departing from the scope of this disclosure.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0044\">One or more controls, e.g., left and right drive control levers <b>110</b> (left lever <b>110</b><i>a</i>, right lever <b>110</b><i>b</i>) may also be provided. The drive control levers <b>110</b> are pivotally coupled to the mower such that they may pivot forwardly and rearwardly under the control of an operator sitting in an operator's seat <b>112</b>. The drive control levers <b>110</b> are operable to independently control speed and direction of their respective drive wheels <b>106</b> via manipulation of the mower's drive system as is known in the art. While illustrated herein as incorporating separate drive control levers <b>110</b>, other controls, e.g., single or multiple joysticks or joystick-type levers, steering wheels, etc. may also be used without departing from the scope of the disclosure. In the illustrated embodiment, a pair of front swiveling ground-engaging members (e.g., caster wheels <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b</i>) may support a front portion of the mower <b>100</b> in rolling engagement with the ground surface <b>103</b>. Of course, other drive configurations (e.g., actively steered front and/or rear wheels, tri-wheel configurations) and vehicles using ground-engaging members other than wheels (e.g., tracks), are certainly contemplated within the scope of this disclosure.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0045\">An implement adapted to perform a maintenance task, e.g., a lawn mower cutting deck <b>114</b>, may be connected to, or otherwise carried by, the chassis <b>102</b> of the mower <b>100</b>, e.g., generally between the drive wheels <b>106</b> and the caster wheels <b>108</b>. The cutting deck <b>114</b> may include a deck housing <b>117</b> that partially defines an enclosure forming a downwardly-opening cutting chamber (not shown). The cutting chamber may partially surround one or more rotatable cutting blades (also not shown), each attached to a blade spindle assembly as is known in the art. Of course, other cutting decks (e.g., out-front decks, towed decks, reel units, etc.), as well as other implements, are contemplated within the scope of this disclosure.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0046\">During operation, power is selectively delivered to the cutting deck <b>114</b> (e.g., to the spindle assemblies) and the drive wheels <b>106</b>, whereby the cutting blades rotate at a speed sufficient to sever grass and other vegetation as the deck passes over the ground surface <b>103</b>. Typically, the cutting deck <b>114</b> includes an operator-selectable height-of-cut control system <b>115</b> to allow deck height adjustment relative to the ground surface <b>103</b>. The cutting deck <b>114</b> may optionally include anti-scalp rollers <b>113</b> as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> to assist in reducing blade/ground contact.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\">With this general overview, an embodiment of an exemplary control system <b>200</b> will now be described. As shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, the control system <b>200</b> may include a control area or panel <b>201</b>, an exemplary embodiment of which is illustrated in more detail in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>. The control panel <b>201</b> may be positioned on the mower at a location that is conveniently accessible to the operator while sitting in the operator's seat <b>112</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>). While not wishing to be bound to any specific configuration, the control panel <b>201</b> may include operator-selectable controls (e.g., switches) configured to provide inputs to the control system <b>200</b>, an embodiment of which is shown schematically in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>. For example, the control panel <b>201</b> may include a key/ignition switch <b>202</b> (not shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>) for starting the engine <b>104</b> or otherwise activating the vehicle's electrical system. Moreover, the control panel may include a display screen <b>212</b> associated with an interactive display (ID) <b>210</b>. The ID may present vehicle information including, but not limited to, accumulated engine run time (hour meter), engine temperature, engine RPM, fuel level, and interlock (e.g., PTO (clutch) mechanism, park brake, etc.) status.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\">In the illustrated embodiment, the control panel <b>201</b> may also include a user-selectable PTO engagement switch <b>204</b>. The exemplary PTO engagement switch <b>204</b> may be configured as a two-setting (e.g., push-pull between off and on states) mechanical switch. While the PTO engagement switch <b>204</b> (as well as other switches described herein) is described and illustrated herein as a mechanical switch that physically moves between its different switch positions, the term &#x201c;switch,&#x201d; as used herein, is understood to encompass most any device that may allow actuation of a device or system or otherwise selectively allow a change in setting of the device or system. For example, switches as described herein may be non-movable switches such as contact switches and optical switches. In still other embodiments, &#x201c;switch&#x201d; may refer to other types of moving or non-moving actuation devices including, for example, touch screen elements, pressure-sensitive elements, and the like. As a result, the term &#x201c;position&#x201d; (as used herein with respect to a switch), is understood to encompass any distinct manipulation or output provided by a non-movable switch. Moreover, the term &#x201c;movable&#x201d; and its variations (as again used herein to describe aspects of a switch), are understood to include any manipulation of the switch that results in altering the switch's setting or output, regardless of whether this manipulation is accompanied by actual physical movement of the switch.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0049\">The control panel <b>201</b> may further include the ID <b>210</b>. The ID <b>210</b> may form an interface for interacting with the EC (which is indicated by reference numeral <b>220</b> in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>) and various vehicle systems. In addition to the screen <b>212</b>, the ID also includes, in one embodiment, one or more (e.g., three) discrete inputs or input elements that allow operator selection/interaction with the information presented on the screen <b>212</b>. In some embodiments, the inputs are configured as three physical, push-button switches <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, and <b>218</b> whose particular function changes in correspondence with information presented on the screen <b>212</b>. However, as indicated above, the input elements could take most any form (e.g., touch screen elements or other types of mechanical, optical, or contact switches) without departing from the scope of this disclosure. While illustrated herein as two separate components, the EC and ID may be constructed as one integral module.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0050\">As further described below, the system <b>200</b> (e.g., the EC <b>220</b>) may monitor various functions and processes regarding vehicle operation. For example, the EC may monitor vehicle parameters via one or more sensors <b>223</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>). These sensor(s) <b>223</b> may include (but are not limited to): a clutch current sensor; a voltage sensor; an engine and/or transmission temperature sensor; an engine oil pressure sensor, an operator presence sensor (e.g., seat switch); a drive lever <b>110</b> position (e.g., neutral) sensor; a ground speed sensor, parking brake position sensor, etc. The signals from these sensors <b>223</b> may be utilized as inputs to other vehicle functions, e.g., they may operate as interlocks that must be satisfied before various mower operations begin.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0052\" num=\"0051\">As shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, the EC <b>220</b>, which may be carried on the chassis <b>102</b>, may include a processor <b>221</b>, memory <b>219</b>, and other components necessary or beneficial to EC operation. The memory <b>219</b> may include computer-readable instructions that, when executed, e.g., by the processor <b>221</b>, cause the EC <b>220</b> to perform various functions. The memory <b>219</b> may include any volatile, non-volatile, magnetic, optical, and/or electrical media, such as a random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), non-volatile RAM (NVRAM), electrically-erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), flash memory, and/or any other digital media. While shown as both being incorporated into the EC <b>220</b>, the memory and the processor could be contained in separate modules. Moreover, the EC <b>220</b> could be combined with an engine-specific control module so that all electronic functions of the vehicle and engine are combined into one component.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0053\" num=\"0052\">The processor <b>221</b> of the EC <b>220</b> may include any one or more of a microprocessor, a controller, a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and/or equivalent discrete or integrated logic circuitry. In some examples, the processor <b>221</b> may include multiple components, such as any combination of one or more microprocessors, one or more controllers, one or more DSPs, one or more ASICs, and/or one or more FPGAs, as well as other discrete or integrated logic circuitry. The functions attributed to the EC <b>220</b>/processor <b>221</b> herein may be embodied as software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof. While described herein as a processor-based system, an alternative EC could utilize other components such as relays and timers to achieve the desired results, either alone or in combination with a microprocessor-based system.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0054\" num=\"0053\">In one or more embodiments, the exemplary systems, methods, and interfaces (e.g., the maintenance monitor described herein) may be implemented using one or more computer programs using a computing apparatus such as the processor <b>221</b> and memory <b>219</b>. Program code and/or logic described herein may be applied to input data to perform functionality described herein and generate desired output information. The output information may be applied as an input to one or more other devices and/or methods as described herein or as would be applied in a known fashion. In view of the above, it will be readily apparent that the EC functionality as described herein may be implemented in any manner known to one skilled in the art.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0055\" num=\"0054\">As stated elsewhere herein, this description is organized by headings/subheadings for organizational purposes only. That is, the particular headings/subheadings are not intended to limit in any way the embodiments described therein, i.e., alternative embodiments may be found elsewhere in the specification. Accordingly, the specification is to be considered as a whole.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0005\" level=\"1\">Engine Speed Control</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0056\" num=\"0055\">As shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, the switches <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, and <b>218</b> may function (during typical mower operation) as separate engine speed command inputs (engine speed selection switches) that correspond, respectively, to three discrete engine speed settings. For example, the button <b>214</b> may correspond to a low engine speed setting, while the button <b>216</b> corresponds to an intermediate or &#x201c;efficient&#x201d; engine speed setting (greater than the low engine speed setting). Finally, the button <b>218</b> may correspond to a high engine speed setting (greater than the efficient engine speed setting). Of course, the engine speed command associated with each of these buttons may vary. For example, the function of the buttons <b>214</b> and <b>218</b> could be switched (e.g., buttons <b>214</b> and <b>218</b> could correspond to the high and low engine speed commands, respectively). Operation of these engine speed selection switches is further described below.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0057\" num=\"0056\">As one can appreciate, while the engine speed command inputs are described and illustrated herein as three distinct switches, such a configuration is not limiting. In fact, most any switch or combination of switches (or switch-like devices) capable of together providing multiple (e.g., two or more) discrete speed settings as described herein is possible without departing from the scope of this disclosure.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0058\" num=\"0057\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref> is an exemplary, schematic diagram of portions of the control system <b>200</b> of the mower <b>100</b>. As shown herein, the mower <b>100</b> may be configured as a zero-radius-turning mower driven by a wheel drive system having dual hydrostatic transmissions <b>126</b>, each powered by the engine <b>104</b> (e.g., via one or more drive belts, not shown). Each transmission <b>126</b> may independently control the speed and direction of its respective drive wheel <b>106</b> based upon input provided by the operator, e.g., via the respective drive control levers <b>110</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>). Accordingly, the mower may be directed over the ground surface <b>103</b> in the desired direction and at the desired speed via the wheel drive system.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0059\" num=\"0058\">To selectively provide power to the cutting deck <b>114</b> (or other implement), the engine <b>104</b> may include an output or drive shaft <b>120</b> configured to operatively couple to, and decouple from, an implement drive system <b>124</b> under the control of an engagement mechanism (e.g., PTO <b>122</b>). In one embodiment, the implement drive system <b>124</b> (which could be, e.g., a belt drive system or a shaft drive) may be connected to the implement (e.g., to the cutting deck <b>114</b>) and selectively rotated by the engine <b>104</b> when the PTO <b>122</b> (disposed between the implement drive system and the drive shaft <b>120</b> of the engine) is engaged.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0059\">As used herein, the term &#x201c;PTO&#x201d; may include most any controlled engagement system including, for example, a conventional electro-magnetic clutch, a continuously variable transmission device, or any other equivalent power transmission system (including, e.g., wheel propulsion transmissions). In embodiments wherein the PTO is configured as a clutch, the PTO may be energized (e.g., the PTO may be engaged (placed into an engaged state) whereby it operatively connects the engine to the implement/implement drive system <b>124</b> to provide power to the latter) by an electric current provided to the clutch, producing a magnetic field that draws two opposing clutch components (see, e.g., <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>) tightly together, effectively permitting transmission of torque through the clutch. To de-energize the PTO <b>122</b> (e.g., to disengage the clutch (place it into a disengaged state) whereby the engine is disconnected or de-coupled from the implement/implement drive system), the electric current is terminated. Once the current is terminated, the clutch components may separate, mechanically disconnecting the implement drive system <b>124</b> from the drive shaft <b>120</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0061\" num=\"0060\">While illustrated as a clutch mechanism, the PTO may again include most any device/method that permits the transmission of power from the prime mover to an implement or subsystem associated with the vehicle.

In such a vehicle, the &#x201c;PTO&#x201d; may simply be a switch that provides power from the electric motor to a pump associated with the spray system.</p>\n",

Moreover, a system incorporating EGOV in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure may be used with or without an EFI system. For example, EGOV can be used with a diesel engine and with a carbureted engine without issue. In some embodiments, an RPM feedback signal <b>128</b> may optionally be provided to the EC, e.g., for closed loop engine speed control.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0067\" num=\"0065\">Of course, the exemplary engine speeds identified in Table I are selected based upon the output and other characteristics of a particular engine (e.g., a model ECV940 EFI with EGOV gasoline engine distributed by Kohler Engine Division, Kohler Co., of Kohler, Wis., USA) and/or a particular implement. As a result, other engine speeds for some or all of the categories identified in Table I are certainly possible without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Moreover, while the maximum engine speed switch <b>218</b> provides the same engine speed regardless of the position of the PTO switch <b>204</b>, other embodiments may apply a speed differential between these two conditions as well.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0066\">As shown in Table I, the engine speed may be commanded to a discrete speed setting based upon operator selection (e.g., via actuation of one of the switches <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, and <b>218</b>) and on whether the PTO <b>122</b> is engaged or disengaged. In some embodiments, at least one of the switches, e.g., the low engine speed selection switch <b>214</b>, may provide further functionality. For example, actuation of the low engine speed selection switch <b>214</b> for a period of time less than a predetermined first or initial threshold period may result in the EC <b>220</b> commanding a speed of the engine <b>104</b> to a first preset or predetermined speed (e.g., see S<sub>LOW,PE </sub>in Table I above). However, actuation of the low engine speed selection switch <b>214</b> for a period of time equal to or greater than the initial threshold period may result in the EC <b>220</b> commanding the speed of the engine to a second preset speed different than the first preset speed. The EC <b>220</b> may further be operable to command the speed of the engine <b>104</b> to a third preset speed, different than both the first and second preset speeds, upon continued actuation of the low speed selection switch <b>214</b> for a total period of time greater than a predetermined second threshold period (which is, of course, greater than the initial threshold period). Such a process may continue until the speed command reaches a minimum speed threshold, below which implement/vehicle performance (e.g., resistance to engine stall) may be detrimentally affected.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0067\">In some embodiments, the initial threshold period is equivalent to a predetermined step interval, and all subsequent threshold periods are set equal to a multiple of the step interval. For instance, the initial threshold period described above may be equal to a step interval of x seconds, wherein the second threshold period would then be equal to 2(x) seconds, a third threshold period would be equal to 3(x) seconds, etc. (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4B</figref>).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0068\">An example of such an EC speed control process <b>300</b> is illustrated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4A</figref>. As shown in this view, the process is entered at <b>302</b>. The EC may monitor the status of the switches <b>218</b>, <b>216</b>, and <b>214</b> at <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, and <b>308</b>, respectively. In the event that the switch <b>218</b> or <b>216</b> is actuated, the EC <b>220</b> may enter the appropriate engine speed command procedure at <b>310</b> or <b>312</b>, respectively. As the following exemplary embodiment is focused on functionality of the low engine speed selection switch <b>214</b>, the procedures of <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> are not further addressed herein. However, those of skill in the art will appreciate that a process similar to that described herein with respect to the switch <b>214</b> may, in other embodiments, be applied to the switches <b>218</b> and <b>216</b> without departing from the scope of this disclosure.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0069\">Once the EC <b>220</b> detects actuation of the switch <b>214</b> at <b>308</b>, the EC may issue a first engine speed command equal to S<sub>LOW,PE </sub>at <b>314</b>. Note that this description assumes that the PTO <b>122</b> is already engaged such that the implement (e.g. cutting deck <b>114</b>) is running. If the PTO is not engaged, the EC may engage the PTO via an engagement process such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,002,585. Moreover, while this process is described for operation when the PTO is engaged, it may optionally apply to transport (PTO disengaged) modes as well.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0070\">The EC <b>220</b> may then set a counter &#x201c;A&#x201d;=1 as indicated at <b>316</b> in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4A</figref>. The EC may continuously monitor, or receive a signal indicative of, an actuation interval or time that the switch <b>214</b> remains actuated (e.g., the time that the operator presses or holds the switch in its on state) and compare that time to a step interval at <b>318</b>. If the EC determines that the actuation time is less than the step interval at <b>318</b> (e.g., if the switch is released (e.g., placed in its off state) before expiration of the step interval), the process may progress to <b>326</b>, whereby engine speed is unaffected, and control is returned to <b>302</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0071\">If, on the other hand, the EC determines that the actuation time is greater than or equal to the product of the counter &#x201c;A&#x201d; (set to a value of one initially) multiplied by the step interval, the EC may progress to <b>320</b>. At <b>320</b>, the EC may check to ensure that the engine is running above a minimum speed threshold (e.g., a threshold set at 2,000-2400 RPM, below which implement operation may be detrimentally affected). If the engine speed is determined to be in excess of the minimum threshold speed at <b>320</b>, the EC may issue a command to the engine speed regulator (e.g., EGOV <b>222</b> of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>) to reduce the engine speed command at <b>322</b> by a predetermined increment or amount (e.g., &#x201c;x&#x201d; RPM).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0072\">The EC <b>220</b> may then index the counter &#x201c;A&#x201d; by one at <b>324</b> and return control to <b>318</b> as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4A</figref>. The current actuation time is then compared again to the product of the step interval multiplied by the counter A (now equal to 2) at <b>318</b>. If step <b>318</b> is satisfied, and engine speed is still above the minimum speed threshold at <b>320</b>, the EC may again issue to the EGOV a revised (e.g., reduced) engine speed command at <b>322</b> to reduce engine speed by &#x201c;x&#x201d; RPM. This process may continue until the EC determines that the engine speed is no longer greater than the minimum speed threshold of the engine at <b>320</b>. When this occurs, the algorithm may progress to <b>326</b>, resulting in no further change in engine speed, after which control is returned to <b>302</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0073\">As one can appreciate, the EC <b>220</b> may thus actually determine the number of expired step intervals encompassed by the detected switch actuation time (see, e.g., <b>318</b>). Based upon this determination, the EC may, in real time, continuously step the engine speed command downwardly in proportion to the actuation time of the switch <b>214</b>, e.g., in synchronization with each expired step interval.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0076\" num=\"0074\">By way of example only, the step interval may be a fixed value set by the EC of 0.3-0.6 seconds, e.g., 0.4 seconds. If the operator actuates the switch <b>214</b> for less than 0.4 seconds, the EC <b>220</b> will command the engine speed to S<sub>LOW,PE </sub>(e.g., 3250 RPM) at <b>314</b> and such speed will not be altered by the process <b>300</b>. However, if the operator continues to hold the switch <b>214</b> in the on state for more than 0.4 seconds (one step interval), the EC may command the engine speed to reduce by the predetermined value &#x201c;x,&#x201d; e.g., 50 RPM. Likewise, if the switch <b>214</b> remains actuated for more than 0.8 seconds (two step intervals), the EC may again ramp the engine speed command down by another 50 RPM. This process may continue until the engine speed command is at or near the minimum speed threshold, e.g., 2250 RPM, at which point further actuation of the switch <b>214</b> has no effect on engine speed command due to the determination made at <b>320</b>. If the switch <b>214</b> is released and subsequently actuated again, the EC may return the engine speed command to the preset S<sub>LOW,PE</sub>, where it may again ramp the speed command downwardly if the switch remains engaged (in the on state). In another embodiment, instead of returning to the preset S<sub>LOW,PE </sub>and ramping the speed downwardly therefrom, actuating the switch <b>214</b> again could instead begin ramping downwardly from the previous speed set point (e.g., the EC could generate a reduced third engine speed command that is lower than a second engine speed command present when the switch <b>214</b> is first re-actuated. Of course, generating the third engine speed command could require that the switch <b>214</b> be actuated for a period of time greater than the step interval).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0077\" num=\"0075\">The processor <b>221</b> of the EC <b>220</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>) may execute the process <b>300</b> (including steps <b>318</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>322</b>, and <b>324</b>) several times a second, resulting in the EC effectively stepping the engine speed command down (in steps of 50 RPM) in proportion to the actuation time of the switch <b>214</b>. Accordingly, the operator may achieve a range of desired lower engine speeds, using the single switch <b>214</b>, via a simple (e.g., press-and-hold) action, and without the need for supplemental engine speed controls.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0078\" num=\"0076\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4B</figref> is a graph illustrating engine speed command generated by the EC vs. actuation time of the low engine speed selection switch <b>214</b> in accordance with embodiments of this disclosure. As stated above, as long as the actuation time of the switch is less than the first threshold period <b>350</b> (e.g., 0.4 seconds), the engine speed command will be set to the first preset speed <b>351</b>, e.g., S<sub>LOW,PE</sub>. However, if the actuation time of the switch <b>214</b> is for a period of time equal to or greater than the first threshold period <b>350</b>, the EC may command the speed of the engine to a second preset speed <b>352</b> different (e.g., 50 RPM less) than the first preset speed <b>351</b>. Moreover, if the switch <b>214</b> remains actuated for a period of time equal to or greater than the second threshold period <b>353</b>, the EC may command the speed of the engine to a third preset speed <b>354</b> different (e.g., 50 RPM less) than the second preset speed <b>352</b>. This process may continue until the commanded speed is at or near the minimum speed threshold at <b>357</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0079\" num=\"0077\">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4B</figref> (using the process <b>300</b> of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4A</figref>), the first and second threshold periods <b>350</b>, <b>353</b> may correspond to a multiple (e.g., one and two, respectively) of the step interval <b>355</b> that, in one embodiment, may be 0.4 seconds. However, in other embodiments, the threshold periods could be different (e.g., the EC may utilize a variable step interval). Moreover, while shown herein as altering the engine speed command by a predetermined increment <b>356</b> of 50 RPM for each step, other embodiments may vary this increment.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0080\" num=\"0078\">By providing the EC with low engine speed functionality like that described, the operator may reduce low speed implement operation where the default low engine speed S<sub>LOW,PE </sub>is perceived as too high. For example, a speed lower than S<sub>LOW,PE </sub>may be beneficial when mowing around landscaped beds to, for example, reduce the distance and velocity of discharged clippings into and immediately around the beds.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0006\" level=\"1\">Property Statistics</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0081\" num=\"0079\">While the switches <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, and <b>218</b> of the ID <b>210</b> may function as engine speed control inputs during mower operation, the EC <b>220</b> may provide a variety of other functions also accessible through the ID and its associated switches. One such function provided is related to tracking and reporting individual property statistics, embodiments of which are now described.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0082\" num=\"0080\">In commercial landscape contracting, accurate tracking and capture of the costs associated with servicing each property are important as such information allows the equipment operator to profitably provide services. Typically, cost is estimated through the use of a conventional engine hour meter. That is, subtracting the hour meter reading at the beginning of a job (property) from the hour meter reading at the end of the job to arrive at a number that correlates to job cost. While effective, engine run time may not always reflect the true cost associated with a particular property. For example, a property having hilly terrain may utilize more fuel than a similarly sized, but flat, property.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0083\" num=\"0081\">To address these issues, embodiments of the present disclosure may provide the EC <b>220</b> with property tracking capability. For instance, in some embodiments, the EC <b>220</b> may, as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, include a first or system memory <b>230</b> and a second or property memory <b>232</b>. One or both of the system memory <b>230</b> and the property memory <b>232</b> may further include one or more storage portions. For example, one or both of the memories <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> may include: a first storage portion <b>231</b> adapted to record an accumulated time that the PTO <b>122</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>) has been engaged; and a second storage portion <b>233</b> adapted to record an accumulated time that the prime mover (e.g., engine <b>104</b>) has been operating (&#x201c;accumulated engine run time&#x201d;). The property memory <b>232</b> may be resettable such that its associated storage portions <b>231</b>, <b>233</b> are selectively reset to a zero value (reset such that the accumulated time that the engine has been operating and the accumulated time that the PTO has been engaged are both set back to zero). However, the system memory <b>230</b> is non-resettable such that its respective storage portions reflect, at all times, the accumulated engine run time and PTO engaged time over the life of the mower. Stated another way, the contents of the system memory <b>230</b> are preserved even when the contents of the property memory <b>232</b> are selectively erased.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0084\" num=\"0082\">In addition to monitoring accumulated or elapsed engine run time and PTO engaged time, either or both of the system and property memories <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> may also track other statistics including, for example: an accumulated volume of fuel used by the engine; average fuel economy; average engine speed; etc. and store/record such information in an associated third storage portion <b>235</b>. Of course, such additional data stored in the third storage portion associated with the property memory <b>232</b> may be resettable (reset to a zero value) whenever the property memory is reset.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0085\" num=\"0083\">As used herein, the term &#x201c;memory&#x201d; (or &#x201c;memory unit&#x201d;) refers, without limitation, to any electronic memory operable to store and retrieve information. Like the memory <b>219</b> of the EC <b>220</b>, each memory <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> (and their corresponding storage portions), as well as the maintenance memory <b>251</b> described below, may include any appropriate volatile, non-volatile, magnetic, optical, and/or electrical media, such as a random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), non-volatile RAM (NVRAM), electrically-erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), flash memory, and/or any other digital media that can store the associated data and, in the case or the property memory, be selectively resettable/erasable.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0086\" num=\"0084\">As stated above, the property memory <b>232</b> is selectively (e.g., via operator action) erasable to permit the reset function, while the system memory <b>230</b> is non-erasable (additional time will accumulate and be retained permanently). Moreover, as used herein, the term &#x201c;storage portion&#x201d; is used merely to identify a portion or register of a memory (or an independent memory device accessible by the memory) where data is actually stored. &#x201c;Resettable,&#x201d; as used herein, indicates only that the memory, e.g., property memory (and/or its individual storage portions), may be reinitialized to a zero value, wherein any data (e.g., accumulated time) stored therein are removed, thereby allowing the mower/EC to track statistics from zero for a new property. The phrase &#x201c;non-resettable&#x201d; is used to indicate that the memory, e.g., system memory (and/or its individual storage portions), is not adapted to be re-initialized, i.e., a non-resettable memory will reflect all data accumulated since first use of the vehicle.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0087\" num=\"0085\">It is noted that additional property memories may be provided to permit storing property statistics for additional properties. For example, in addition to the property memory <b>232</b>, the EC <b>220</b> may include one or more additional property memories, each being capable of storing data regarding a specific property (e.g., each having storage portions <b>231</b>, <b>233</b>, and <b>235</b>), and each being independently re-settable. For instance, in one embodiment, the EC may include: a second property memory <b>234</b>; a third property memory <b>236</b>; a fourth property memory <b>238</b>; and a fifth property memory <b>240</b>, wherein contents of one property memory (e.g., the second property memory <b>234</b>) may be erased while preserving the contents of the other property memories (e.g., the first property memory <b>232</b>). As the memories <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, and <b>240</b> are resettable, the mower may be able to store individual statistics (e.g., engine run time (associated with storage portion <b>231</b>), PTO engaged time (associated with storage portion <b>233</b>), fuel utilized since last reset (associated with storage portion <b>235</b>), etc.) for up to five individual properties. By providing multiple property memories, the operator may be able to collect and retain property statistics for an entire day before a reset of any property memory is required. As a result, the transfer of property statistics to a billing system or log may be deferred until the end of the work day, after which the property memories may be reset before the next day's operations. Moreover, by providing multiple property memories, one property memory (e.g., the fifth property memory <b>240</b>) may be reserved for recording statistics for an entire service (e.g., mowing) season. Such a use may be beneficial to, for example, track total fuel usage as a basis for seeking potential rebates on road taxes for a given year. A vehicle owner may also assign one property memory to a particular operator to determine, for example, that operator's efficiency compared to others.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0088\" num=\"0086\">Transferring data from any of the EC's memories (e.g., <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, and <b>240</b>, as well as from memories <b>219</b> and <b>251</b>) to an operator billing system or log may be accomplished via most any acceptable method. For instance, manual transfer, as well as electronic data uploading (wired or wirelessly) of the contents of the memories is contemplated.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0089\" num=\"0087\">In some embodiments, the operator may interact with the property statistics information via the ID <b>210</b> and its switches <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, and <b>218</b>. For instance, although EC/ID may typically assign engine speed settings to the switches <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>, (see icons along lower edge of exemplary ID screen <b>212</b>, such icons corresponding to the current function of the switches <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, and <b>218</b>), simultaneously pressing a key combination (e.g., keys <b>214</b> and <b>218</b>) may cause the EC <b>220</b> to enter a menu mode, an exemplary ID screen of which is illustrated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref>. Upon entering the menu mode, icons corresponding to various aspects of the control system may be presented on the screen <b>212</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref>, the screen <b>212</b> may initially present: a meter icon <b>402</b>; a service icon <b>404</b>; a settings icon <b>406</b>; and a language selection icon <b>408</b>. Moreover, the function of the switches <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, and <b>218</b> may now be mapped to: cancelling the current operation (<b>218</b>); navigating through the icons presented (<b>216</b>); and selecting the highlighted icon (<b>214</b>).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0090\" num=\"0088\">To access property statistics, the meter icon <b>402</b> (highlighted in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref>) may be selected (if the meter icon is not highlighted, the switch <b>216</b> may allow navigation through the available icons until the meter icon is highlighted) by actuating (e.g., pressing) the switch <b>214</b>. After pressing the switch <b>214</b>, the operator may navigate (again using the switches <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, and <b>218</b> to interact with information presented on the screen <b>212</b> of the ID <b>210</b>) to any one of the property statistics screens.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0091\" num=\"0089\">A first property statistics screen (e.g., &#x201c;Property Statistics <b>1</b>&#x201d; corresponding to the data stored in the storage portions of the property memory <b>232</b> of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>) may appear as shown in the ID screen <b>212</b> of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref>. This screen illustrates the contents of the property memory <b>232</b> after the mower has been operating for some time (since the last reset). As a result, statistics representing accumulated engine run time, accumulated PTO engaged time, and volume of fuel used are presented as shown (while shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref> in relation to the property memory <b>232</b>, a similar screen can be viewed for any of the other property memories, and for the system memory <b>230</b> (the latter showing total statistics over the life of the mower)). The screen presented in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref> also shows the statistics in a &#x201c;paused&#x201d; mode, i.e., recording accumulation of additional statistics (e.g., PTO engaged time, engine run time) to the property memory <b>232</b> is suspended. The operator may start/resume recording of statistics (e.g., PTO engaged time, engine run time) to the property memory <b>232</b> again by selecting the &#x201c;play/resume&#x201d; function now associated with switch <b>218</b>. After actuating the switch <b>218</b>, the EC <b>220</b> will again begin to accumulate the engine run time, PTO engaged time, and fuel used and additively store such accumulated information in the property memory <b>232</b>. Fuel usage may be determined by a number of methods and/or devices including, for example: detecting a change in level of fuel <b>133</b> contained in a fuel tank <b>134</b> (e.g., using a sensor <b>135</b> as indicated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>); monitoring fuel flow into the engine <b>104</b> with a flow sensor (not shown); or by calculating fuel usage based upon data provided, by an engine-specific controller (not shown), to the EC.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0092\" num=\"0090\">Alternatively, if the operator wishes to reset the property memory <b>232</b>, the switch <b>214</b> may be actuated (when the screen of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref> is presented). Upon actuation of the switch <b>214</b> (e.g., engaging the switch, e.g., for more than one second), the storage portions associated with the property memory unit may be reset, such that counters for engine run time, PTO engaged time, and fuel used are reset to zero as shown in the screen <b>212</b> of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref>. The operator may, at the appropriate time, actuate the switch <b>218</b>, now corresponding to a &#x201c;play&#x201d; function (see icon above switch <b>218</b> in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref>), to begin recording new (e.g., from zero) statistics to the property memory <b>232</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0093\" num=\"0091\">Once the play (i.e., record) function is activated as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref>, property statistics will begin to accumulate to the property memory <b>232</b> and this accumulated information will be displayed on the appropriate ID screen <b>212</b> as illustrated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref>. If the operator wants to pause or suspend accumulation of property statistics to the property memory <b>232</b> for any reason, the operator may navigate again to the desired property statistics screen. Instead of presenting the screen shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref>, however, the ID may now illustrate a &#x201c;pause&#x201d; icon above the switch <b>218</b> as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref>. Actuation of the switch <b>218</b> will then pause the accumulation of additional data to the property memory <b>232</b> until the switch <b>218</b> (whose respective function reverts back to &#x201c;play&#x201d; after pausing) is again actuated, at which point property statistics are again accumulated. The switch <b>218</b> may thus operate as a pause/resume input to selectively pause recording of data to the storage portion(s) of the associated property memory, and then resume recording when the switch <b>218</b> is subsequently actuated.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0094\" num=\"0092\">While only the ID screen renderings for the property statistics associated with the first property memory <b>232</b> are shown, similar screens, and similar functionality, are provided for each of the property memories (e.g., <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, and <b>240</b> of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0095\" num=\"0093\">As one of skill may appreciate, multiple and resettable property statistic logging may thus simplify accurate capture of data associated with each property.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0007\" level=\"1\">Modified Service Intervals</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0096\" num=\"0094\">In addition to providing resettable property statistics, the EC <b>220</b> may further provide a maintenance monitor carried by the chassis and adapted to indicate when various maintenance tasks, e.g., changing of engine oil <b>130</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>), changing of transmission oil <b>131</b> (see also <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>), changing of gearbox oil, etc., should be performed. In addition to indicating when these maintenance tasks are due, the maintenance monitor may also include a maintenance memory to permanently store or record an onboard log indicating, at each time the maintenance task was completed, a record of: completion of the maintenance task; and either the accumulated run time of the engine, or the accumulated time that the PTO has been engaged. Accordingly, as used herein, &#x201c;maintenance interval,&#x201d; as it refers to any specific maintenance task, may refer to either: an elapsed run time of the prime mover since the maintenance task was last performed (or until the maintenance task is again due); or an elapsed time that the PTO has been engaged since the maintenance task was last performed (or until the maintenance task is again due). The maintenance monitor may also include a first input associated with the ID. The first input may be adapted to receive operator input indicating that the maintenance task is complete. After receiving the operator input, the maintenance interval may be reset to either: a first duration; or a second duration different than the first duration.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0097\" num=\"0095\">The maintenance monitor may be also be adapted to receive one of either a first or second maintenance input corresponding to a first or second parameter of the maintenance task, respectively. For example, the maintenance monitor, via the ID <b>210</b>, may request the operator to select a type of oil being used, wherein the first maintenance input (e.g., selection of a premium oil) results in the maintenance monitor setting the maintenance interval to the first duration, and the second maintenance input (e.g., not selecting a premium oil) results in the maintenance monitor setting the maintenance interval to the second duration. As a result, the actual maintenance interval that will elapse before the operator again receives an indication that the particular maintenance task is due may be adjusted by the maintenance monitor to better correlate to an expected service life of the product (e.g., engine, transmission, or gearbox oil) used (see, e.g., <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16</figref>).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0098\" num=\"0096\">While the selection of this maintenance parameter is limited in this example to whether or not a specific premium product was used (e.g., to a product or component (e.g., oil, lube, grease, belts, etc.) having a longer expected service life than a standard version of the product or component), other embodiments of the maintenance monitor may present multiple (e.g., a list of) options (e.g., three or more oil types) from which to select. Some of these options could be pre-programmed, while others could be user-definable, and each option could set a different maintenance interval.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0099\" num=\"0097\">It is noted that, while described herein in the context of engine, transmission or gearbox oil, the actual maintenance task may include most any maintenance activity associated with the mower <b>100</b>. For instance, the maintenance monitor may alter the maintenance interval for maintenance tasks including, for example: air cleaner replacement; spark plug replacement; fuel filter replacement; belt replacement, and chassis lubrication based on the particular replacement product or component utilized.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0100\" num=\"0098\">As shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, the maintenance monitor may be an electronic controller <b>250</b> incorporated into, or otherwise in communication with the EC <b>220</b> (e.g., with the processor <b>221</b> of the EC). In other embodiments, the maintenance monitor may be embodied in the processor <b>221</b> (e.g., it may be a program executed by the processor). The maintenance monitor and/or the EC may be configured to constantly monitor and record the accumulated run time of the engine and the accumulated time that the PTO has been engaged (the total time that the PTO has been engaged for operation). A maintenance memory <b>251</b> (which could be part of the memory <b>219</b>) may also be included to permanently store a record of: completion of the maintenance task; and the accumulated run time of the engine (and/or the accumulated engagement time of the PTO) at the time the maintenance task was completed. As with other systems described herein, the maintenance monitor may include, or otherwise utilize, the ID <b>210</b> as an input/output device for interacting with the operator or service technician regarding maintenance tasks. Transferring data from the maintenance monitor to an external device or maintenance log may be accomplished via most any acceptable method. For instance, manual transfer, as well as electronic data uploading (via a wired or wireless connection) of the contents of any stored memory are contemplated.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0101\" num=\"0099\">To access maintenance records, the operator may navigate to the menu screen (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref>) and select the maintenance icon <b>404</b>. This will bring the user to the maintenance monitor functions, of which one screen is illustrated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref>. The operator or technician may cycle through other maintenance screens using the navigation functions now assigned to the switches <b>214</b> and <b>218</b> as shown to determine a status of one or more maintenance intervals each corresponding to the performance of a maintenance task.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0102\" num=\"0100\">The ID <b>210</b> may display a status screen <b>212</b> like that illustrated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref> showing the remaining hours to elapse until, in this example, changing the transmission oil is recommended. If the mower <b>100</b> has operated beyond the recommended maintenance interval (e.g., the maintenance task is past due), the remaining hours until maintenance is due may be shown as a negative number (e.g., hours past due) as indicated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12</figref>. Actuating the switch <b>216</b> (at either of the screens shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>) may then show the service history for previous transmission oil changes as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13</figref>. As indicated, service history may be indicated by showing the accumulated, non-resettable engine hours for each time this specific maintenance reminder was previously reset. Screens similar to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 11-13</figref> may be presented for other maintenance tasks such as changing engine oil and gearbox oil, belts, air filters, etc.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0103\" num=\"0101\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 14-16</figref> illustrate an exemplary procedure that the operator or service technician may execute during or after performance of a specific maintenance task to set the length of the next maintenance interval. While described and illustrated in the context of changing engine oil, the same procedure would apply to other maintenance tasks (e.g., changing transmission oil). In one embodiment, the maintenance interval reset function is accessed via an &#x201c;Advanced Settings&#x201d; icon <b>406</b> as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0104\" num=\"0102\">Upon entering the Advanced Setting menu, the system may require entry of a system passcode, which again may be input using the switches <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, and <b>218</b> (passcode entry screen not shown). As shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14</figref>, once the maintenance task reminder indicates that the task is due (or about due), the maintenance task (e.g., changing engine oil) may be completed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0105\" num=\"0103\">After task completion, the maintenance reminder may be reset by, for example, accessing the screen shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14</figref> (if not already present) and pressing the switch <b>216</b> (while shown with reference to engine oil, generally the same screens may be presented (only the title bar would change) for other maintenance tasks, e.g., changing transmission oil). The maintenance monitor may then prompt for confirmation of the reset as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15</figref>. Once confirmed by actuation of the switch <b>218</b>, the ID <b>210</b> may prompt the operator/technician for the type of oil used. For example, as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16</figref>, the maintenance monitor may ask (via the screen <b>212</b> of the ID <b>210</b>) if a premium oil (e.g., extended life oil that has an expected service life greater than a standard engine oil) was used. If the answer is yes, the operator/technician may press the switch <b>218</b> confirming the same. If, on the other hand, a premium oil was not used, the operator/technician may indicate the same by pressing the switch <b>214</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0106\" num=\"0104\">While the selection of this maintenance parameter (e.g., premium oil having an expected service life greater than a typical engine oil) is limited in this example to whether or not a specific premium product was used, other embodiments of the maintenance monitor may present multiple (e.g., a list of) options (different oils) from which to select.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0107\" num=\"0105\">In the illustrated embodiment, if the premium oil is indicated, the maintenance monitor may set the next maintenance interval for this maintenance task to a first duration (e.g., 500 hours). However, if not selected, the maintenance monitor may select the next maintenance interval to a second duration different (e.g., lower) than the first (e.g., 250 hours).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0108\" num=\"0106\">While described herein as utilizing an elapsed run time of the prime mover (e.g., engine <b>104</b>) to establish maintenance intervals for various maintenance tasks, such a configuration is exemplary. That is, other embodiments may utilize other triggers to establish the maintenance interval. For instance, some mowers could establish maintenance intervals based upon an accumulated time that the PTO has been engaged (since the maintenance task was last performed). Such embodiments may be useful for maintenance tasks (e.g., belt replacement) that are more dependent upon PTO engagement time rather than on engine run time.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0109\" num=\"0107\">Accordingly, the maintenance monitor may adjust the maintenance interval for at least some maintenance tasks to reflect a selection parameter (e.g., premium oil) of a particular maintenance item used. As a result, more cost-effective vehicle operation may be achieved by, for example, extending the next maintenance interval when a premium product (e.g., oil) is used as opposed to maintaining a static maintenance interval regardless of the product used.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">This invention relates to weed or grass trimmer apparatuses using a trimming head and trimmer line retention devices with a flexible trimmer line which is rotated at a relatively high speed during operation.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0003\" level=\"1\">BACKGROUND</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">Presently, there are trimming apparatuses known in the art having a rotatable, attachable head for attachment to a powered device, with the head carrying a series of trimmer lines extending axially out about the periphery of the head. Examples of such weed trimming apparatuses include spool and &#x201c;bump &#x2018;n&#x2019; feed&#x201d; weed trimming apparatuses with continuous-feed trimming line and trimming apparatuses using fixed-length pieces of trimming line. However, current weed trimming apparatuses have certain drawbacks which have gone largely unaddressed in this technical field. Some weed trimming apparatuses require extensive time to change trimmer line, while others may require tools to take apart the head of the trimming apparatus to change the trimmer line. Still others suffer from high rates of trimmer line breaking due to the fixed manner in which the retention device of the trimmer line operates.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">Accordingly, there is still a great and long-felt need for a weed trimmer apparatus that provides quick and easy trimmer line insertion and security during operation as well as simple and efficient trimmer line removal when changing trimmer line. There is also a great and long-felt need for a weed trimmer apparatus which enjoys increased trimmer line durability and integrity while being simple to use and maintain.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0004\" level=\"1\">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">The present invention addresses the foregoing needs in a highly unique and facile way. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a novel weed trimmer apparatus, particularly weed trimmer heads including rotating components from which trimmer line cutting members may extend. Particularly, in at least one of its aspects, this invention provides quick and easy trimmer member insertion and security during operation. In another aspect, the invention also facilitates removal of trimmer member during change out, so that there is no need to disassemble the head of the trimmer apparatus, as required in other known trimmer head apparatuses. Therefore, no tools are needed for trimmer member removal and replacement. Also, certain embodiments of the present invention allow for operation of the device in a fixed mode or, in alternative embodiments, an oscillatory mode, depending on the way the trimmer member is attached to the head.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">In at least one embodiment, the present invention relates to a weed or grass trimming apparatus (hereinafter &#x201c;weed trimmer apparatus&#x201d;) using a trimming head and at least one trimmer member retention device with a trimmer member which is rotated at a relatively high speed during operation. Certain embodiments of the present invention may be used with, for example, a hand-held, powered tool or a walk-behind device. The hand-held tool may be equipped with a very long handle or a more compact, hand-gun-like design or the like. Examples of a hand-held tool include, but are not limited to, the long-handled version of weed trimmers, such as a WEED EATER&#xae; device or the like. Alternatively, the weed trimmer apparatus may take the form of a wheeled-type, powered device in which the user walks behind the device. The weed trimmer heads may be attached to an electrically, gas, hand, or similarly powered device which causes the trimmer head to rotate at relatively high speeds. Furthermore, in a particular embodiment of the invention, a more flexible trimmer line, e.g. rope, may be retained by the trimmer line retention members and the weed trimmer apparatus may be used in a broom-like manner, where the draft of air generated by the rotation of the trimmer line and the trimmer line itself may displace objects (e.g., leaves, grass, etc.) from an area in which the weed trimming apparatus is being operated.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">In one of its embodiments, the present invention provides a weed trimmer apparatus which comprises a head defining at least one side wall, the side wall forming one or more apertures therethrough, and one or more line retention members for retaining one or more trimmer members, the line retention members being operatively connected to the head, wherein each line retention member is sized and configured to extend through a loop or aperture of at least one trimmer member during operation of the weed trimmer apparatus and wherein each retention member is dynamically connected to the head to allow for installation and removal of the trimmer member. In a preferred embodiment, a weed trimmer apparatus is provided comprising a rotating head supporting trimmer members, a glider plate to guard against excessive wear of the trimmer members, a glider shaft coupleable at one end with the rotating head, and a bearing acting between the glider plate and the glider shaft. Preferably, the glider plate is configured to rotate or remain stationary independent of and relative to any rotation of the head. Preferably, the glider plate is substantially circular in shape and is connected to the a lower-most plate of the head. In a preferred embodiment, the glider plate is selectively positionable relative to the rotating head to adjust a cutting height of the trimmer members, by turning of the connecting bolt which acts against the bias of the spring and thus adjusts the position of the glider plate relative to the rotating head.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">Another embodiment of the present invention is a weed trimmer apparatus comprising a head defining at least one side wall, the side wall forming one or more apertures therethrough, and one or more line retention members for retaining one or more trimmer lines, the line retention members being operatively connected to the head, wherein each line retention member is sized and configured in the form of a hook, wherein each hook extends through a loop of at least one trimmer line during operation of the weed trimmer apparatus. In a preferred embodiment, a trimmer head for a rotary cutting apparatus comprises a body portion, a trimmer member passage extending through the body portion from a trimmer member entrance opening to a trimmer member install position, and a trimmer member fastening mechanism having a trimmer member engaging member. In such preferred embodiment, that trimmer member engaging member is pivotally movable between a first position and a second position.

      "<heading id=\"h-0002\" level=\"1\">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">The present invention relates generally to lawn maintenance devices, and more particularly, to a wheeled device to be attached to a grass trimmer or brush cutter to provide support to the grass trimmer and to facilitate moving around of the grass trimmer so as to alleviate the fatigue of the operator of the grass trimmer.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0003\" level=\"1\">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">String trimmers, also known as weed whackers, weed eaters, or weed whips, were invented during the 1970's as a way to more easily trim grasses around trees, bushes, flowers, fences, mailboxes, and structures. Instead of kneeling down with a pair of scissor-like hand trimmers which have been used by gardeners to arduously clip their gardens and lawns for centuries, the job could now be accomplished with relative ease by walking next to the desired cutting area and extending a pole containing a cutting head with a motor-driven spool of monofilament line designed to efficiently and easily cut weeds and grasses. In addition to monofilament line, other cutting materials used include plastic and metal blades and chains. However, the monofilament line is by far the most prevalent material used for cutting the grass and weeds. In addition to cutting weeds and grass, the configuration of a powered cutting head attached to a pole can be applied to a hedge trimmer, brush cutter, and a cultivator. In fact, there are string trimmers that are sold as &#x201c;combo kits,&#x201d; that contain a separate brush cutting blade that can be interchanged with a string cutting head to give it greater versatility.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">Most of the above-mentioned cutting tools are powered by gasoline motors. There are also machines that use electric power. These electric machines are lighter but require an electrical cord attachment which limits their maneuverability since the cord has to be untangled and unattached from various items as it drags across the ground. Electric machines including an integrated battery are also known in the art, and are heavy and often bulky due to the added battery. In general, electric models are also typically less powerful than their gasoline counterparts, leading to decreased performance and limiting them to light-duty jobs.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">Gasoline-powered cutting tools for the most part have two-stroke engines that use a mixture of oil and gasoline and are extremely polluting. Some gasoline-powered cutting tools now have four-stroke engines that use gasoline only. These engines are more powerful and less polluting; however, they are typically much heavier and can cause worker fatigue from the excess weight of the engine. The machine must be moved back and forth and sideways, while holding it at a constant height, and leading to repetitive movements by the arms, hands and shoulders, which could cause a stress or wearing type of injury such as carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">For really heavy duty jobs, there is still another type of trimmer&#x2014;the walk-behind trimmer. This resembles a lawn mower in that it has two large wheels in the back and a metal cutting deck similar to a small mower, which contains a trimmer head with much heavier monofilament line or cutting blades. These machines are extremely powerful and can handle larger jobs that a typical string trimmer cannot. However, these machines are heavy and difficult to maneuver and are thus not practical for homeowners to use for their residential properties which typically do not have a large enough yard for this type of trimmer. Further, these machines are very expensive, costing up to ten times more than an average trimmer.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">As stated above, when using a trimmer, operator fatigue can occur. This may become very dangerous since a tired operator might move the cutter in an unsafe manner, increasing the danger of striking an unintended object, or injuring himself. Some trimmers include shoulder or back straps to alleviate the fatigue. However, even with these straps, holding a trimmer for a long period of time while trying to maintain a certain height can still lead to strain on the arms, hands and shoulders of the operator and thus cause fatigue.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">The machines can also cut erratically since it can be difficult to maintain an even cutting height when holding the rotating head a few inches above the ground while moving sideways or in an irregular pattern especially for a prolonged period of time. The string may also accidentally scalp the ground, causing a gouge, or even tear off tree bark if the operator moves too close to a tree.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">Therefore, there is an established need for a convenient and labor-saving device that can be easily attached to a hand-held grass trimmer or brush cutter and that can help the grass trimmer or brush cutter to cut in a stable manner, while alleviating fatigue to the operator.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0004\" level=\"1\">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">The present invention is directed to a convenient and labor-saving wheeled support that facilitates the carrying and moving around of the grass trimmer or brush cutter. The grass trimmer wheeled support includes a support body to be attached to the grass trimmer or brush cutter, or integrally formed with a cutting head or safety guard of the grass trimmer or brush cutter, and at least two preferably omnidirectional swivel caster wheels attached to a bottom of the support body. The support body can have a variety of different shapes and structures. More than one wheeled support can also be used for one grass trimmer or brush cutter, for instance, one being attached to the shaft and one being attached to the safety guard, to increase the stability. In another example, two wheeled supports (having the same structure or different structures) may be attached to the shaft at different locations.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\">In a first implementation of the invention, a wheeled support for a grass trimmer or brush cutter includes a support body to be attached to the grass trimmer or brush cutter, and at least two wheels coupled to the support body, and rotatable in relation to the support body. The wheeled support can further include a connector for removably attaching the support body to a shaft of the grass trimmer or brush cutter. The connector can be arranged at a top end of the support body opposite to a bottom end of the support body at which the at least two wheels are coupled.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\">In another implementation of the invention, a grass trimmer or brush cutter assembly comprises a shaft, an engine at a proximal end of the shaft, and a trimmer or cutter head at a distal end of the shaft, the trimmer or cutter head having a safety guard. The grass trimmer or brush cutter assembly further includes at least two wheels rotatably affixed to a structure of the grass trimmer or brush cutter assembly. The wheels extend from the structure to allow the grass trimmer or brush cutter assembly to roll on a ground or surface. The structure can be removably attached to the shaft. Alternatively, the structure can be integrally formed in the trimmer or cutter head, for instance in the safety guard of the trimmer or cutter head.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0014\" num=\"0013\">In yet another implementation of the invention, a grass trimmer or brush cutter assembly comprises a shaft, an engine at a proximal end of the shaft, a trimmer or cutter head at a distal end of the shaft, and at least two wheels rotatably affixed to a structure of the grass trimmer or brush cutter assembly. The at least two wheels extend from the structure to allow the grass trimmer or brush cutter assembly to roll on a ground or surface. The at least two wheels include a first set of at least one wheel arranged on one side of the grass trimmer or brush cutter, and a second set of at least one wheel arranged on an opposite side of the grass trimmer or brush cutter. When observing the grass trimmer or brush cutter assembly in top plan view, the first set, second set and trimmer or cutter head are arranged in a triangle and the shaft extends between the first set and the second set, rendering the grass trimmer or brush cutter assembly stable, easy to carry and safe.</p>\n",

It is also to be understood that the specific devices and processes illustrated in the attached drawings, and described in the following specification, are simply exemplary embodiments of the inventive concepts defined in the appended claims. Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics relating to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting, unless the claims expressly state otherwise.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0035\" num=\"0034\">Shown throughout the figures, the present invention is directed toward a convenient and labor-saving wheeled support that is capable of being easily attached to a hand-held grass trimmer or brush cutter to provide support to the grass trimmer or brush cutter and also facilitate the moving around of the grass trimmer or brush cutter.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0035\">Referring now to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, a grass trimmer wheeled support <b>100</b> is illustrated in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the grass trimmer wheeled support <b>100</b> is attached to a grass trimmer <b>10</b> that includes a shaft <b>12</b>, a trimmer head <b>14</b> with a safety guard <b>16</b>, a handle <b>18</b>, and an engine <b>20</b>. As can be best seen in the slightly enlarged, partial view of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, the wheeled support <b>100</b> includes a support body <b>110</b> having a connector <b>120</b> at a top end thereof and brackets <b>130</b> at a bottom end thereof. The connector <b>120</b> is configured to couple to the shaft <b>12</b> of the grass trimmer <b>10</b> for attaching the wheeled support <b>100</b> to the grass trimmer <b>10</b>. In turn, the brackets <b>130</b> provide a support for holding preferably caster wheels <b>140</b>, which are arranged facing downwardly in order to rest on the ground <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>, while the grass trimmer <b>10</b> is being operated to cut grass. The caster wheels <b>140</b> preferably present an omnidirectional swivel relative to the support body <b>110</b>. The grass trimmer wheeled support <b>100</b> thus makes it possible for the grass trimmer <b>10</b> to move in all directions while the support body <b>110</b> supports the shaft <b>12</b> of the grass trimmer <b>10</b> in an elevated position as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref> without the user having to carry the grass trimmer <b>10</b> full weight.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0037\" num=\"0036\">In the present embodiment, the support body <b>110</b> has an inverted Y-shape with two symmetrical divergent segments <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> extending from two corresponding symmetrical parallel top segments <b>113</b> and <b>115</b>. The top segments <b>113</b> and <b>115</b>, in turn, extend from an anchor or connector <b>120</b> defining a space <b>121</b> for receiving the shaft <b>12</b> of the grass trimmer <b>10</b>. As can be more clearly seen in the exploded view of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, the connector <b>120</b> allows for connecting the wheeled support <b>100</b> firmly to the shaft <b>12</b>. As best shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>, the space <b>121</b> of the connector <b>120</b> can be arranged at an angle other than 90 degrees with the Y-shaped support body <b>110</b> in order for the shaft <b>12</b> to extend in a tilted fashion when the Y-shaped support body <b>110</b> stands vertically on the ground <b>30</b>. The connector <b>120</b> can be formed, for instance and without limitation, as an open or slotted ring molded to adjust to the size and shape of the shaft <b>12</b>. Pin holes <b>122</b> can be provided in the top segments <b>113</b> and <b>115</b> of the two divergent segments <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> so that a pin or bolt may be inserted through the pin holes <b>122</b> to more securely clamp the wheeled support <b>100</b> to the shaft <b>12</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\">The brackets <b>130</b> hold position of the swivel caster wheels <b>140</b> with a few inches distance W between the wheels <b>140</b> (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>). Distance W can vary, for instance and without limitation, from 8 to 15 inches, providing a very stable horizontal position on the ground. With reference to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>, the vertical distance H between each bracket <b>130</b> and the mounting point of the connector <b>120</b> on the shaft <b>12</b> can vary, for instance and without limitation, from 8 to 12 inches, to allow the change of height on the grass string trimmer and brush cutter machines. The caster wheels <b>140</b> can each have a diameter of preferably at least 2.5 inches. In fact, the present embodiment is particularly convenient for large size swivel caster wheels (for example, 5-inch swivel caster wheels), which can make cutting grass on a yard with a rough terrain possible. Although the support body <b>110</b> of the wheeled support <b>100</b> may be made from various materials including a strong plastic, light aluminum is preferable. In turn, the swivel caster wheels <b>140</b> can be made of plastic, metal or combinations thereof.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\">Referring now to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, a grass trimmer wheeled support <b>200</b> is illustrated in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the grass trimmer wheeled support <b>200</b> is arranged at or near an upper surface <b>17</b> of the safety guard <b>16</b> of the trimmer head <b>14</b>. The grass trimmer wheeled support <b>200</b> includes a support body <b>210</b>, the support body <b>210</b> generally including a central anchor or connector <b>220</b> and two opposing arms <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>. The opposing arms <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> extend along a same longitudinal direction forming a straight, elongated plate or strip. The connector <b>220</b> extends from a top surface of the elongated plate or strip, and includes a space <b>221</b> for receiving the shaft <b>12</b> of the grass trimmer <b>10</b>, the connector <b>220</b> thus providing a fastener for coupling the glass trimmer wheeled support <b>200</b> to the grass trimmer <b>10</b>. The connector <b>220</b> can be attached to the shaft <b>12</b> by a frictional fitting, or by one or more screws, spring-biased locks, magnets and/or other applicable fasteners. Two preferably omnidirectional swivel caster wheels <b>240</b> are attached to and extend downward from each end of the support body <b>210</b>, and more particularly from a bottom surface of the elongated strip or plate formed by the opposing arms <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>. This embodiment can be used for all grass string trimmers and brush cutters, but is particularly suitable for brush cutters of the type that comprises a metal blade.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\">Referring now to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>, a grass trimmer wheeled support <b>300</b> is illustrated in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the grass trimmer wheeled support <b>300</b> includes a support body <b>310</b> having an anchor or connector <b>320</b> at one end thereof. The connector <b>320</b> a space <b>321</b> for receiving the shaft <b>12</b> of the grass trimmer <b>10</b>, and can be secured to the shaft <b>12</b> by a frictional fit or one or more fasteners or fastening mechanisms, similarly to the previous embodiments. At an opposite end of the support body <b>310</b>, two spaced apart brackets <b>330</b> hold preferably omnidirectional swivel caster wheels <b>340</b>. In this embodiment, the support body <b>310</b> has a vertical inverted V-shape with two divergent segments <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> extending symmetrically from the connector <b>320</b>.

      "<p id=\"p-0002\" num=\"0001\">The present invention relates to a lawn mower. More specifically, the present invention relates to a raising and lowering mechanism for a mower deck of a lawn mower.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0002\" level=\"1\">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">Lawn mower is a garden machine which is specially used for mowing lawns. Typically, it comprises a frame, a mower deck, an engine, a driving mechanism, wheels, blades, steering means as well as other control components. High speed blades are provided within the mower deck, and a grass discharge opening is typically provided in a side wall of the mower deck, and the grass discharge opening is provided with a cover thereon. At the bottom of the mower deck, mower deck supporting wheels are generally mounted. The mower deck moves along with the frame and the running wheels, and the height of the mower deck determines the height of mowing, i.e., only the grass higher than the blades will be cut. The mower deck of a conventional lawn mower will be suspended from the frame via a chain, and the mowing height may be varied by adjusting the position of a height limit pin. The efficiency of such a structure in adjusting the height of the mower deck is low, and the mower deck tends to waggle when the lawn mower is running or changing speed. Thus, the mower deck as a whole is not sufficiently stable, which would affect the flatness of mowing.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0003\" level=\"1\">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">It is an objective of the present invention to address the technical problems of the prior art, and provide a raising and lowering mechanism for a mower deck of a lawn mower. By using the raising and lowering mechanism of the present invention, the mower deck can be suspended stably from the lawn mower frame, and the height of the mower deck can be adjusted quickly and conveniently if required.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">The raising and lowering mechanism for a mower deck of a lawn mower of the present invention comprises a frame and a mower deck hanging from the frame, the raising and lowering mechanism further comprises a front hanger and a rear hanger; the front hanger and the rear hanger are, independently, a four link frame, with a front end of the front hanger and a front end of the rear hanger being hinged, independently, to the frame of the lawn mower, and a lower portion of a rear end of the front hanger and a lower portion of a rear end of the rear hanger being hinged, independently, to a top portion of the mower deck; a first link is hinged to a middle portion of a rear link of the four link frame of the rear hanger, and an upper end of the first link is linked to a lower end of a bridging swing arm, with a middle portion of the bridging swing arm being hinged to the frame of the lawn mower via a spindle; an upper end of the bridging swing arm is hinged to a rear end of a second link, and a front end of the second link is hinged to an upper end of a swing arm, with an lower end of the swing arm being connected to a rotatable axle and able to rotate with respect to the rotatable axle; one end of the rotatable axle is fixedly connected with a driving lever, with an upper end of the driving lever being in screw connection with a fine adjustment screw; an end of the fine adjustment screw opposite a head thereof extends rearward and against a middle portion of the swing arm; the other end of the rotatable axle is connected with a handle which is operable to drive the rotatable axle to rotate.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">As compared with prior art, the present invention can achieve the following beneficial effects: the mower deck is hanged under the front hanger and the rear hanger, and when the handle is pushed forward, the rotatable axle rotates in the clockwise direction, which causes the driving lever to rotate in the clockwise direction, then the end of the fine adjustment screw opposite a head thereof pushes the upper end of the swing arm to rotate rearward, and the swing arm forces the bridging swing arm to rotate in the clockwise direction via the second link; the bridging swing arm then forces the first link to swing upward, and the first link forces the rear end of the rear hanger to swing upward, thereby raising the mower deck. In contrast, when the handle is pulled rearward, the mower deck <b>16</b> will be lowered. In the present invention, the height of the mower deck can be fine adjusted by manually rotating the fine adjustment screw to move the screw back and forth; the position of the end of the fine adjustment screw opposite a head thereof will determine the position limit to which the upper end of the swing arm can swing forward, and in turn determine the mowing height of the mower deck; the rearward movement of the swing arm will not be limited; when the ground surface is not flat and a little hillock is present, upon contact of a support wheel with the little hillock, the mower deck as a whole can be lifted, and avoid collision with the little hillock, thereby avoiding damage of the lawn and impact on the mechanical structure due to &#x201c;dig the ground&#x201d;.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, an upper end of the handle is extended outside of a slot at a top of a handle adjuster frame, and at one side of the slot is provided with a plurality of locking slots in which the handle can be locked. The handle is able to swing forward and backward in the slot to adjust the height of the mower deck, and when the mower deck is adjusted to a desirable height, the handle can be swung to, and locked in a respective locking slot such that the height of the mower deck can be maintained.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, an lower end of the handle is connected, preferably welded, with a handle sleeve tube, and a central axis of the handle sleeve tube is substantially perpendicular to a central axis of the rotatable axle; within the handle sleeve tube, a handle axle is inserted, and two ends of the handle axle are fixedly connected, respectively, to upper ends of two brackets, and the lower ends of the brackets are connected to the rotatable axle. Rotation of the handle sleeve tube with respect to the handle axle will drive the handle to swing to the left or the right so that the handle can enter, or withdraw from, the locking slots freely; swing back and forth of the handle will drive the rotatable axle to rotate via the handle sleeve tube and the brackets connected to the rotate axle, such that the height of the mower deck can be adjusted.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, onto the handle axle, a torsion spring is mounted, wherein the torsion spring functions to push the handle to a bottom of a locking slot. The tension of the torsion spring forces the handle to be locked reliably in the locking slot, thereby avoiding release of the handle from the locking slot.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, an end of the rotatable axle near the handle is supported within an axle hole in a vertical wall of the handle adjuster frame.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a side wall of the swing arm is connected with a swing arm stop plate, and the end of the fine adjustment screw opposite a head thereof sits against the swing arm stop plate.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a holding portion at an upper end of the handle <b>11</b> is provided with a handle cover.</p>\n",

The other end of the rotatable axle <b>8</b> is connected with a handle <b>11</b> which can be operated to drive the rotatable axle <b>8</b> to rotate.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0024\" num=\"0023\">When the handle <b>11</b> is pushed forward, the rotatable axle <b>8</b> rotates in the clockwise direction, which causes the driving lever <b>9</b> to rotate in the clockwise direction. The end of the fine adjustment screw <b>10</b> opposite a head thereof pushes the upper end of the swing arm <b>7</b> to rotate rearward, and the swing arm <b>7</b> forces the bridging swing arm <b>4</b> rotate in the clockwise direction via the second link <b>6</b>. Then, the bridging swing arm <b>4</b> forces the first link <b>3</b> to swing upward, and the first link <b>3</b> forces the rear end of the rear hanger <b>2</b> to swing upward, thereby raising the mower deck <b>16</b>. In contrast, when the handle <b>11</b> is pulled rearward, the mower deck <b>16</b> will be lowered.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0025\" num=\"0024\">The height of the mower deck <b>16</b> can be fine adjusted by manually rotate the fine adjustment screw <b>10</b> to move the screw back and forth. The position of the end of the fine adjustment screw <b>10</b> opposite a head thereof which pushes the upper end of the swing arm <b>7</b> will determine the position limit to which the upper end of the swing arm can swing forward, and in turn determine the mowing height of the mower deck <b>16</b>. The rearward movement of the swing arm <b>7</b> will not be limited. When the ground surface is not flat and a little hillock is present, upon contact of a support wheel <b>18</b> with the little hillock, the mower deck <b>16</b> as a whole can be lifted and avoid collision therewith, thereby avoiding damage of the lawn and impact on the mechanical structure.</p>\n",

      "<heading id=\"h-0001\" level=\"1\">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0002\" num=\"0001\">This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/272,677, entitled &#x201c;Adjustable Gathering Chain Assembly for a Header of an Agricultural Harvester&#x201d; and filed May 8, 2014, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>\n",
      "<?cross-reference-to-related-applications description=\"Cross Reference To Related Applications\" end=\"tail\"?>\n",
      "<?summary-of-invention description=\"Summary of Invention\" end=\"lead\"?>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0002\" level=\"1\">BACKGROUND</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">The subject application relates generally to a header for use with agricultural harvesters. In particular, the subject application relates to an adjustable gathering chain assembly for an agricultural harvester header operable to harvest crops, such as corn.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">The header of an agricultural harvester or combine is provided with row dividers and associated hoods for directing rows of corn stalks to downstream separation devices known as row units. The row units include stalk receiving slots and stripping plates, snapping rolls, and opposed rearwardly moving gathering chains. Thus, e.g., following separation of ears from stalks by the snapping rolls and stripping plates (also known as stalk rolls and deck plates, respectively), the separated ears are delivered by the gathering chains to an auger or other conveyor which conveys the harvested ears to a feederhouse of the combine. Harvested ears are then passed to the combine's inner chambers for downstream processing.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">Row units are typically constructed with forwardly projecting members that support several components of the row unit including the deck plates, the stalk rolls, the gathering chains, the rear gathering chain sprockets (drive sprockets), the front gathering chain sprockets (driven sprockets), the hoods and the row dividers. Typical gathering chain assemblies include those in which the driven sprockets are located in a forwardly extended position relative to the leading edge of the deck plates and those where the driven sprockets are disposed in a somewhat retracted position relative to the leading edge of the deck plates. i.e., closer to the combine. Experience has shown that when the driven sprockets are situated in a prominently forward position relative to the deck plates, the header is better suited to gathering and lifting stalks of down or lodged crop. However, when the driven sprockets are situated in a forwardly projecting position, dry stalks tend to be knocked off by the gathering chain paddles before being engaged by the stalk rolls. Furthermore, when the driven sprockets are disposed in a relatively forwardly projecting position, the row units tend to pick up rocks and other debris which can cause clogging or even damage to the header. Conversely, when the driven sprockets are more rearwardly disposed relative to the deck plates, the row units are better suited to gathering crop that is more upright or standing because they knock off fewer standing stalks before they are pulled through the stalk rolls. However, no single location of the driven sprockets has been shown to be effective in harvesting under all crop conditions.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">Accordingly, there is still a need for a row unit gathering chain assembly that addresses the foregoing issues associated with conventional headers. Such needs are satisfied by the subject application.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0003\" level=\"1\">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">In accordance with a first aspect, the subject application provides an adjustable gathering chain assembly for a row unit of a header for an agricultural harvester. The gathering chain assembly includes a drive unit, a driven unit and an endless chain extending between the drive unit and the driven unit. The assembly further includes an adjustment unit for moving the endless chain between first and second positions, as well as a tensioner biasing one of the drive unit and the driven unit for tensioning the endless chain in the first and second positions.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">In accordance with a second aspect, the subject application provides an adjustable gathering chain assembly for a row unit of a header for an agricultural harvester. The gathering chain assembly includes a drive sprocket, a driven sprocket spaced from and movable relative to the drive sprocket and a gathering chain entrained about the drive sprocket and the driven sprocket whereby rotation of the drive sprocket causes rotation of the driven sprocket. The assembly further includes an idler sprocket engaged with the gathering chain and an actuator operatively connected to the idler sprocket and operable to move the idler sprocket between first and second positions.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">In accordance with a third aspect, the subject application provides an adjustable gathering chain assembly for a row unit of a header for an agricultural harvester. The gathering chain assembly includes a drive sprocket, a driven sprocket assembly spaced from and movable relative to the drive sprocket. The driven sprocket assembly includes first and second sprockets carried about opposite ends of an arm pivotably connected to a frame of the gathering chain assembly. A gathering chain is entrained about the drive sprocket and the driven sprocket assembly wherein the driven sprocket assembly pivots between a medial position and a lateral position.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">In accordance with a fourth aspect, the subject application provides a header for an agricultural harvester. The header includes a plurality of row units each including deck plates defining a crop receiving gap therebetween. A drive sprocket and a driven sprocket are rotatably carried by the row unit and the driven sprocket is spaced from and movable relative to the drive sprocket. A gathering chain extends between the drive sprocket and the driven sprocket and an adjustment unit engages the gathering chain. An adjustment mechanism is operatively connected to the adjustment units and operable to move the adjustment units toward and away from the drive sprockets to adjust a distance between the drive sprockets and the driven sprockets. A linkage assembly includes a plurality of linkages connecting the adjustment units and the adjustment mechanism wherein movement of the adjustment mechanism between first and second positions moves the adjustment units between a first position wherein the driven sprockets are at a first distance from the drive unit and a second position wherein the driven sprockets are at a second distance from the drive sprockets.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">In accordance with a fifth aspect, the subject application provides a header for an agricultural harvester. The header includes a row unit including an extendable gathering chain assembly having a drive unit, a driven unit, an endless chain extending between the drive unit and the driven unit, and an adjustment unit configured to move the endless chain. The header further includes a sensor for detecting changes in harvesting conditions about a forward end of the row unit and a feedback control mechanism operatively connected to the sensor and the adjustment unit for causing the adjustment unit to move the endless chain responsive to changes in harvesting conditions detected by the sensor.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\">In accordance with a sixth aspect, the subject application provides a method for adjusting a position of a gathering chain assembly for a row unit of a header for an agricultural harvester, in particular the distance between a drive sprocket and a driven sprocket of the gathering chain assembly. A gathering chain is entrained about the drive sprocket and the driven sprocket such that rotation of the drive sprocket causes rotation of the driven sprocket, and the driven sprocket is spaced from and movable relative to the drive sprocket. The method includes the acts of sensing a first harvesting condition about a forward end of the row unit, moving the gathering chain to a first position upon sensing the first harvesting condition such that the drive sprocket and driven sprocket are spaced apart at a first distance, sensing a second harvesting condition about the forward end of the row unit, and moving the gathering chain to a second position upon sensing the second harvesting condition such that the drive sprocket and driven sprocket are spaced apart at a second distance.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\">In accordance with a seventh aspect, the subject application provides a method for adjusting a position of a gathering chain assembly for a row unit of a header for an agricultural harvester, in particular the relative positions between a driven sprocket and a drive sprocket of the gathering chain assembly. A gathering chain is entrained about the drive sprocket and the driven sprocket such that rotation of the drive sprocket causes rotation of the driven sprocket, and the driven sprocket is spaced from and movable relative to the drive sprocket. The method includes the acts of sensing a first harvesting condition about a forward end of the row unit, moving the gathering chain to a first position upon sensing the first harvesting condition such that the driven sprocket is at a first position relative to the drive sprocket, sensing a second harvesting condition about the forward end of the row unit, and moving the gathering chain to a second position upon sensing the second harvesting condition such that the driven sprocket is at a second position relative to the drive sprocket.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0014\" num=\"0013\">In accordance with an eighth aspect, the subject application provides a selectively adjustable gathering chain assembly for a row unit of a header for an agricultural harvester. The gathering chain assembly enables the distance between the drive sprocket and the driven sprocket to be selectively adjusted by moving the driven sprocket forwardly and rearwardly whereby the header may effectively harvest both standing crop and down or lodged crop. The assembly thus provides the ability to move the leading edge of the gathering chain forward and rearward as needed under varying crop conditions. A mechanical, electrical or hydraulic device may be used to move an idler sprocket against the gathering chain in such a way as to extend or retract the driven sprocket relative to the drive sprocket. A fully mechanical adjustment device requires the operator to adjust the idler sprockets by hand or with a tool, whereas electrical or hydraulic devices may be operated and controlled from the cab of the harvester, either manually or automatically. Adjustment of the length of the gathering chain is required for a field or a portion thereof under which harvesting conditions change during the harvesting process.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0015\" num=\"0014\">It is also contemplated that the row units of a header may be adjusted in sections with certain sections being suited for harvesting down/lodged crop and other sections being suited for harvesting standing crop. For example, a 12-row header may be operable to adjust the right six rows different than the left six rows. Likewise, narrower or wider headers may be similarly adjusted in sections to achieve simultaneous harvesting of both down/lodged and standing crop. In any event, with a gathering chain assembly constructed in accordance with the subject application, the distance that the gathering chain is disposed fore and aft relative to the leading edge of the row unit deck plate is adjustable. Therefore, crop yield is increased notwithstanding changing harvesting conditions.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0032\" num=\"0031\">Reference will now be made in detail to the various aspects of the subject application illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same or like reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like features. It should be noted that the drawings are in simplified form and are not drawn to precise scale. In reference to the disclosure herein, for purposes of convenience and clarity only, directional terms such as top, bottom, left, right, above, below and diagonal, are used with respect to the accompanying drawings. Such directional terms used in conjunction with the following description of the drawings should not be construed to limit the scope of the subject application in any manner not explicitly set forth. Additionally, the term &#x201c;a,&#x201d; as used in the specification, means &#x201c;at least one.&#x201d; The terminology includes the words above specifically mentioned, derivatives thereof, and words of similar import.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0033\" num=\"0032\">Referring now to the drawings, wherein aspects of the subject application are shown, <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an agricultural harvester such as a combine <b>10</b> including a corn header assembly or corn header <b>12</b>. The corn header <b>12</b> is shown to be operatively connected to the agricultural harvester <b>10</b> for harvesting e.g., corn and feeding the corn to a feederhouse for further downstream processing such as receiving crop residue, cutting, chopping and propelling the residue rearwardly and outwardly from the agricultural harvester <b>10</b> while retaining the valuable corn ears and kernels. Such feederhouses and harvesting operations are known in the art and a further detailed description of their structure, function and operation is not necessary for a complete understanding of the subject application. Alternatively, the corn header <b>12</b> can be connected to any device that may have use for a corn header.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0034\" num=\"0033\">Referring to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the corn header <b>12</b> includes a frame <b>14</b> for mounting to a forward end of the agricultural harvester <b>10</b>, a conveyor <b>16</b> (such as an auger) extending lengthwise across the frame <b>14</b> for conveying crop material to a combine feeding location or feederhouse <b>18</b>, and a plurality of row units <b>20</b> extending forwardly from the frame <b>14</b>. The frame <b>14</b> is preferably configured as a substantially rectangular frame, as shown. However, the frame <b>14</b> can be configured as any shape suitable for the foregoing intended use. As seen in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, the frame <b>14</b> includes a rear wall <b>24</b>, a bottom wall <b>26</b> and a pair of side walls <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. The frame <b>14</b> further includes a channel <b>32</b> formed partially by the bottom wall <b>26</b>. The conveyor <b>16</b> conveys harvested corn along the channel <b>32</b> to the combine feeding location <b>18</b> located adjacent a midpoint of the channel <b>32</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0035\" num=\"0034\">The conveyor <b>16</b> can be a screw auger conveyor, but can alternatively be any conveyor capable of moving grain through the channel <b>32</b>, such as a paddle system, a conveyor belt, a pressure based system, or any combination thereof. Such conveyors are known in the art and a further detailed description of their structure, function and operation is not necessary for a complete understanding of the subject application. However, typical augers applicable to the subject application are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,267,240 and 4,621,968, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0035\">The auger <b>16</b> is connected to the frame <b>14</b> at the side walls <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and rotates about axis A. The half of the auger <b>16</b> that is closest to side wall <b>28</b> moves the harvested crop towards the opposite side wall <b>30</b> and the half of the auger <b>16</b> that is closest to side wall <b>30</b> moves the harvested crop towards the opposite side wall <b>28</b>. The auger <b>16</b> is positioned in front or above the combine feeding location <b>18</b> and, as the auger <b>16</b> rotates, harvested grain moves towards the center of the auger <b>16</b> for feeding the harvested grain into the combine feeding location <b>18</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0037\" num=\"0036\">Referring still to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the corn header <b>10</b> further includes a plurality of row dividers <b>34</b>. The row dividers <b>34</b> extend forwardly from the frame <b>14</b> and are connected to extend across a pair of adjacent row units <b>20</b> (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>). Such dividers <b>34</b> are known in the art and a further detailed description of their structure, function and operation is not necessary for a complete understanding of the subject application. However, typical dividers applicable to the subject application are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,625,969 and 7,073,316, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein. The dividers <b>34</b> extend forwardly from the frame <b>14</b> and are connected to the plurality of row units <b>20</b> for directing a row of corn stalks towards stripping plates <b>36</b> (also commonly known as a deck plates) of the row units. During harvesting operations, the row dividers <b>34</b> direct a row of corn stalk towards deck plates <b>36</b> and unillustrated stalk rolls situated beneath the deck plates and between adjacent row dividers. As shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, the deck plates <b>36</b> define a slot or gap <b>40</b> for receiving corn stalks and, as is known, stalk rolls pull the stalk downwardly snapping the corn ear when it strikes the deck plates <b>36</b>. The stalk rolls desirably pull most of the crop residue down and out of the header.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\">Referring to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, each row unit <b>20</b> includes a row unit frame <b>42</b> having a pair of row unit arms <b>44</b> connected by a chassis of the header. Mounted lengthwise on each row unit arm <b>44</b> is an endless gathering chain <b>48</b> having lugs <b>50</b> that direct corn stalks to the rear of the row unit <b>20</b> for the removal of corn ears from the stalks by the deck plates <b>36</b>. In operation, crop material is stripped from the stalk and then travels across a breast plate <b>46</b> to the channel <b>32</b>. The crop material stripped from the stalk is propelled rearwardly to the channel <b>32</b> due to the continuous flow of harvested crop material flowing rearwardly as a result of the actions of the gathering chains <b>48</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\">Each gathering chain <b>48</b> is entrained about a drive sprocket <b>52</b> disposed at a proximal end of a respective row unit arm <b>44</b> and a driven sprocket <b>54</b> located at a distal end of a respective row unit arm. As is known, drive sprocket <b>52</b> is rotated by unillustrated gearing operably connected to the drive train of the agricultural harvester and rotation of the drive sprocket <b>52</b> causes corresponding rotation of the driven sprocket <b>54</b>. Biasing members <b>56</b> such as springs, extensible cylinders or the like are typically provided to exert forwardly directed force against the driven sprockets <b>54</b> in order to maintain tension in the gathering chains <b>48</b> during operation of the header.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\">A shortcoming of the arrangement shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref> is that the distance between the drive sprockets <b>52</b> and the driven sprockets <b>54</b> is not adjustable beyond the ordinary adjustments for maintaining tension on the gathering chain. As such, depending on whether the driven sprockets <b>54</b> are disposed relatively forwardly or relatively rearwardly with respect to the deck plates <b>36</b>, the row unit <b>20</b> is situated to move effectively to gather crop which is either standing or down/lodged, but not both.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\">Referring to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, there is shown an extendable gathering chain assembly <b>160</b> for a row unit <b>120</b> of a header for an agricultural harvester constructed in accordance with an aspect of the subject application. For clarity and simplicity of illustration, shown schematically in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> is a portion of one half of a row unit, in particular the extendable gathering chain assembly <b>160</b> and a deck plate <b>136</b>. It will be understood, however, that a complete row unit will include, among other components, a pair of deck plates and a pair of gathering chain assemblies <b>160</b> situated in opposing relationship and defining a crop receiving slot or gap therebetween similar to slot <b>40</b> of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\">Gathering chain assembly <b>160</b> includes a drive unit <b>152</b>, a driven unit <b>154</b> and an endless chain <b>148</b> extending between the drive unit and the driven unit. Assembly <b>160</b> further includes an adjustment unit <b>170</b>, further described below, for moving the endless chain between first and second positions and a tensioner <b>156</b>, also described below, biasing one of the drive unit and the driven unit for tensioning the endless chain in the first and second positions and all positions therebetween and beyond.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\">The endless chain <b>148</b> is equipped with stalk-engaging lugs <b>150</b> (only one shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref> for purposes of clarity in illustration) and is driven by the drive unit. The drive unit <b>152</b> is configured as a drive sprocket and the driven unit <b>154</b> a driven sprocket. The driven sprocket <b>154</b> is spaced forwardly of the drive sprocket <b>152</b> and, as will be discussed hereinafter, the driven sprocket is movable in the fore and aft direction relative to the drive sprocket. The gathering chain <b>148</b> is entrained about the drive sprocket <b>152</b> and the driven sprocket <b>154</b>, whereby rotation of the drive sprocket causes rotation of the driven sprocket. The drive unit or sprocket <b>152</b> is driven by unillustrated gearing operably connected to the drive train of the agricultural harvester. Such gearing is known in the art and a further detailed description of its structure, function and operation is not necessary for a complete understanding of the subject application.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\">As noted above, gathering chain assembly <b>160</b> includes an adjustment unit <b>170</b>. The adjustment unit <b>170</b> is operable to move the endless chain <b>148</b> between first and second positions. In the first position the driven unit <b>154</b> is at a first distance L<b>1</b> from the drive unit <b>152</b> (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>) and in the second position the driven unit is at a second distance L<b>2</b> from the drive unit (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>). The first position corresponds to an extended position while the second position corresponds to a retracted position. In a first relatively extended position depicted in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>, a leading edge <b>174</b> of the gathering chain <b>148</b> projects significantly forwardly of the leading edge <b>176</b> of the deck plate <b>136</b> so that the gathering chain is better suited to harvesting downed or lodged crop. In a second relatively retracted position depicted in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, the leading edge of the gathering chain is somewhat withdrawn relative to the leading edge of the deck plate such that the gathering chain is better suited to harvesting upright or standing crop. Alternatively expressed, the gathering chain assembly is movable relative to deck plate <b>136</b>. It will be understood, however, that the first and second positions of the leading edge <b>174</b> of the gathering chain shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> are merely illustrative and not limitative of the positions that the leading edge of the gathering chain may assume during operation of an agricultural harvester that includes a header equipped with gathering chain assemblies <b>160</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0044\">In the first position shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref> the endless chain <b>148</b> has substantially parallel sides <b>148</b><i>a </i>and <b>148</b><i>b</i>. In the second position shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> the endless chain has substantially non-parallel sides. That is, in the second position side <b>148</b><i>a </i>is extended or projected laterally outwardly whereas side <b>148</b><i>b </i>is straight. Moreover, in the first position (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>) the endless chain has a first length L<b>1</b> and a first width W<b>1</b> and in the second position (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>) the endless chain has a second length L<b>2</b> smaller than the first length L<b>1</b> and a second width W<b>2</b> larger than the first width W<b>1</b>. Thus, the adjustment unit <b>170</b> is operable to move the endless chain between first and second positions, wherein in the first position the driven unit <b>154</b> is at a first distance from the drive unit <b>152</b> and in the second position the driven unit is at a second distance from the drive unit, the second distance being less than the first distance.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0045\">The adjustment unit <b>170</b> comprises an idler member <b>178</b>, a stem <b>180</b> extending from the idler member and an extendable and retractable member <b>182</b>. Idler member <b>178</b> can be an idler sprocket that engages the gathering chain <b>148</b>. The stem <b>180</b> has a first end <b>184</b> proximal to the idler member and a second end <b>186</b> distal to the idler member. The second end is connected to a frame (not shown) of the gathering chain assembly via extendable and retractable member <b>182</b>. Through stem <b>180</b>, the extendable and retractable member <b>182</b> is operatively connected to the idler sprocket <b>178</b> and operable to move the idler sprocket in the medial and lateral directions of the gathering chain assembly toward and away from the drive sprocket <b>152</b> to adjust a distance between the drive sprocket and the driven sprocket <b>154</b>. Similar to the driven sprocket <b>154</b>, the idler sprocket <b>178</b> is rotated by movement of the gathering chain as a result of rotation of the drive sprocket <b>152</b>. By virtue of extension and retraction of member <b>182</b>, the adjustment unit <b>170</b> is adjustably positionable throughout a range of angles relative to a longitudinal axis A of the gathering chain assembly <b>160</b>. The angle of the adjustment unit <b>170</b> relative to longitudinal axis A, or the lateral displacement of idler sprocket <b>178</b> relative to the drive sprocket <b>152</b>, thus determines the distance between the drive sprocket <b>152</b> and the driven sprocket <b>154</b> or the amount of extension and retraction of the gathering chain assembly. As discussed in greater detail below, the angles that the adjustment unit <b>170</b> can be set by the combine operator or automatically established by a sensor and a feedback control mechanism e.g., controller arrangement responsive to the harvesting conditions associated with a particular field being harvested, e.g., whether crop is standing or down/lodged.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0046\">As depicted in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the extendable and retractable member <b>182</b> can be an actuator such as a pressurized fluid cylinder, e.g., a hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder, or an electronic screw jack. A first end <b>190</b> of the actuator is operable to move the idler member <b>178</b> between first and second positions laterally toward and away from the drive sprocket <b>152</b> and a second end <b>192</b> of the actuator is connected to the frame of the gathering chain assembly. According to an aspect, the stem <b>180</b> can be a crank arm having a first end <b>184</b> pivotably connected to idler member <b>178</b> and a second end <b>186</b> pivotably connected to the first end <b>190</b> of the actuator <b>182</b>. Between its first and second ends <b>184</b>, <b>186</b> the stem <b>180</b> can be pivotably connected to the frame at pivot <b>194</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\">The gathering chain assembly <b>160</b> further includes a tensioner <b>156</b> operatively connected to the driven sprocket <b>154</b> for exerting a tensioning force against the endless gathering chain <b>148</b> in the first and second positions and all positions therebetween and beyond. By way of example and not limitation, tensioner <b>156</b> can bias the driven sprocket <b>154</b> to impart tension to the gathering chain <b>148</b> independent of the position of the driven sprocket relative to the drive sprocket. For example, tensioner <b>156</b> can include a compression spring <b>196</b> surrounding a threaded rod <b>198</b>. The threaded rod can be anchored to the frame while the spring can be disposed between a nut <b>199</b><i>a </i>and a movable support <b>199</b><i>b </i>for the driven sprocket <b>154</b>. With the tensioner <b>156</b> so constructed, turning of nut <b>199</b><i>a </i>in one direction compresses the spring <b>196</b> thereby increasing the force exerted by the tensioner on the chain <b>148</b> and turning of the nut in the opposite direction permits the spring to expand thereby decreasing the force exerted by the tensioner on the chain. It will be understood that tensioner <b>156</b> may assume other forms such as a pressurized fluid cylinder or a combination of such cylinder with the above-described spring and rod assembly.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\">Referring to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, there is illustrated a further aspect of the subject application, in particular, a gathering chain assembly <b>260</b> of row unit <b>220</b> shown in a first extended position (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>) and a second retracted position (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref>) relative to a deck plate <b>236</b>. Gathering chain assembly <b>260</b> is in many respects similar to gathering chain assembly <b>160</b> described above. Accordingly, only those features which depart materially in structure and/or function from their counterparts depicted in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> or are otherwise necessary for a complete understanding of the subject application will be described in detail.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0049\">Assembly <b>260</b> includes a drive unit or drive sprocket <b>252</b>, a driven unit or driven sprocket <b>254</b>, an endless gathering chain <b>248</b> extending between the drive and driven sprockets and an adjustment unit <b>270</b>. According to an aspect, the adjustment unit <b>270</b> comprises an idler member <b>278</b>, a stem <b>280</b> extending from the idler member and an extendable and retractable member <b>282</b>. Idler member <b>278</b>, stem <b>280</b> and extendable and retractable member <b>282</b> are constructed, arranged and function in substantially similar fashion to idler member <b>178</b>, stem <b>180</b> and extendable and retractable member <b>182</b> of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. However, extendable and retractable member <b>282</b> can be a manually adjustable member such as a turnbuckle or the like that can be adjusted by hand or a suitable tool, e.g., a wrench. Alternatively, it can be adjusted via a hydraulic or electric motor configuration.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0050\">When the extendable and retractable member <b>282</b> is constructed as a turnbuckle, the turnbuckle <b>282</b> includes first and second oppositely threaded shafts <b>282</b><i>a</i>, <b>282</b><i>b </i>which are joined by an internally threaded shaft connector <b>282</b><i>c</i>. Shaft <b>282</b><i>b </i>can be affixed to the gathering chain assembly frame (not shown) and shaft <b>282</b><i>a </i>can be connected to stem <b>280</b> and movable relative to shaft <b>282</b><i>b</i>. Whether turned by hand, a tool or a reversible motor, the shaft connector <b>282</b><i>c </i>may be rotated in order to extend or retract shaft <b>282</b><i>a </i>relative to shaft <b>282</b><i>b</i>. That is, rotation of shaft connector <b>282</b><i>c </i>in one direction causes shaft <b>282</b><i>a </i>to move toward shaft <b>282</b><i>b </i>and rotation of the shaft connector in the opposite direction causes shaft <b>282</b><i>a </i>to move away from shaft <b>282</b><i>b</i>. As shaft <b>282</b><i>a </i>is drawn toward shaft <b>282</b><i>b </i>by rotation of shaft connector <b>282</b><i>c </i>in a first direction, stem <b>280</b> may rotate counterclockwise (as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>) about pivot <b>294</b> until the idler member <b>278</b> (which again can be an idler sprocket) assumes the position shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>. In this position, the opposite sides of endless chain <b>248</b> are substantially parallel and the driven unit or driven sprocket <b>254</b> and the leading edge <b>274</b> of the chain are fully extended with respect to the leading edge <b>276</b> of deck plate <b>236</b>. Conversely, as shaft <b>282</b><i>a </i>is pushed away from shaft <b>282</b><i>b </i>by rotation of shaft connector <b>282</b><i>c </i>in a second direction opposite the first direction, stem <b>280</b> rotates clockwise (as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>) about pivot <b>294</b> until the idler member <b>278</b> assumes a position as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref> whereby the opposite sides of endless chain <b>248</b> are not parallel. That is, the idler sprocket <b>278</b> is displaced laterally away from the drive sprocket <b>252</b> and/or the driven unit or driven sprocket <b>254</b> and the gathering chain assembly is retracted such that a leading edge <b>274</b> of chain <b>248</b> is correspondingly retracted in relation to a leading edge <b>276</b> of the deck plate <b>236</b>.</p>\n",

As shown, the adjustment unit <b>370</b> comprises an idler member or sprocket <b>378</b> and a stem <b>380</b> extending from the idler member. Unlike the previously described adjustment units which include extendable and retractable actuators or turnbuckles, adjustment unit <b>370</b> includes a pivoting or swinging stem <b>380</b> having one end pivotably attached to the gathering chain assembly frame at pivot <b>394</b> and a second end connected to and rotatably supporting idler sprocket <b>378</b>.

The driven sprocket is spaced from and movable relative to the drive sprocket in the manner discussed above in respect to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4-9</figref>. Likewise, gathering chain <b>448</b> extends between and is entrained about the drive sprocket and the driven sprocket. Moreover, gathering chain assemblies <b>460</b> additionally include unillustrated tensioners similar in structure and function to the tensioners <b>156</b>, <b>256</b> and <b>356</b> described above. It will be understood that such drive units, driven units and tensioners are constructed and function similar to their counterparts disclosed above in connection with <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4-9</figref>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0057\" num=\"0056\">As seen in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref>, an adjustment unit <b>470</b> is provided which engages the gathering chain <b>448</b> and includes an idler member or sprocket <b>478</b>. An adjustment mechanism <b>405</b> comprising a manual, powered or automatically operated extendable and retractable member <b>407</b> which is operable to move idler sprocket <b>478</b> laterally with respect to a longitudinal axis A of the gathering chain assembly and/or the drive sprocket. That is, the adjustment mechanism <b>405</b> is operatively connected to the adjustment unit <b>470</b> and operable to move the adjustment unit laterally toward and away from the drive sprocket and the longitudinal axis A to adjust a distance between the drive and driven sprockets. The adjustment mechanism <b>405</b> can be a manual or powered actuator that exerts force upon an adjustment rod <b>411</b>, described below, in order to provide desired adjustment of the length of gathering chain <b>448</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0058\" num=\"0057\">According to the aspect illustrated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref>, the header includes a linkage assembly <b>409</b> having a plurality of linkages. Each of the linkages connects the adjustment unit <b>470</b> and the adjustment mechanism <b>405</b>. So constructed and arranged, movement of the adjustment mechanism <b>405</b> between first and second positions moves the adjustment unit <b>470</b> between a first position wherein the driven sprocket is at a first distance from the drive sprocket and a second position wherein the driven sprocket is at a second distance from the drive sprocket. For example, the linkage assembly <b>409</b> includes an adjustment rod <b>411</b> operatively connected to the adjustment mechanism <b>405</b> and each of the plurality of linkages. The adjustment rod <b>411</b> extends substantially the width of the header and carries a plurality of linkage assemblies <b>409</b>. The plurality of linkages is arranged in a spaced apart relationship along the length of the adjustment rod.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0059\" num=\"0058\">According to an aspect, each of the plurality of linkages includes a first link <b>413</b> having first and second ends <b>413</b><i>a </i>and <b>413</b><i>b</i>, respectively, that is pivotably mounted to a chassis of the gathering chain assembly frame at pivot <b>494</b>. The first end <b>413</b><i>a </i>of the first link <b>413</b> is connected to idler sprocket <b>478</b> of the adjustment unit <b>470</b>. Each of the plurality of linkages also includes a second link <b>419</b> fixedly mounted to the adjustment rod <b>411</b> and a third link <b>421</b> connecting the second end <b>413</b><i>b </i>of the first link <b>413</b> with the second link <b>419</b>. With the plurality of linkages so constructed and arranged, motive force exerted by the adjustment mechanism <b>405</b> causes movement of the second links <b>419</b> and the adjustment rod <b>411</b>. Such rotational motion causes linear motion to be transferred from the second links <b>419</b> to the first links <b>413</b> through the third links <b>421</b>. Consequently, the first links <b>413</b> rotate about pivots <b>494</b> and move the adjustment unit <b>470</b> toward and away from the drive sprockets.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0059\">While <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref> shows a single adjustment mechanism <b>405</b> for operating a plurality of adjustment units <b>470</b> and linkage assemblies <b>409</b>, it will be appreciated that more than one adjustment mechanism may be provided to achieve the same effect. By way of example but not limitation, the number of adjustment mechanisms <b>405</b> can correspond substantially in number to the number of adjustment units <b>470</b> and linkage assemblies <b>409</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0061\" num=\"0060\">According to the subject application, control of the adjustable gathering chain assembly can be realized in various ways. For instance, and as described above, adjustment of the distance between the driven sprocket and the drive sprocket can be achieved by moving the idler member or idler sprocket via activation of a powered actuator such as a hydraulic cylinder, pneumatic cylinder or a screw jack, or by operation of a manually adjustable mechanism such as a turnbuckle. In the case of a powered actuator, extension and retraction of the actuator can be achieved by conscious user action. More particularly, the header can be provided with a user-operated controller <b>423</b> (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref>) via which the user or operator may selectively activate the adjustment mechanism, e.g., the extendable and retractable member <b>182</b> of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> or the member <b>407</b> (if hydraulically, pneumatically, electrically or otherwise powered) by operation of a motor <b>444</b>. Motor <b>444</b> can be any suitable hydraulic, pneumatic or electric motor that is operable to respond to commands from controller <b>423</b>. Controller <b>423</b> may be located externally of the cab of the combine harvester. However, for user convenience, controller <b>423</b> can be located within combine cab. In order to assist the user in controlling the actuator using controller <b>423</b>, <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref> indicates that the header may be provided with an optional video camera <b>425</b> located at, adjacent to or otherwise directed toward the forward end <b>403</b> of the row unit whereby the camera can provide visual images of the crop being harvested so that the operator can make real-time adjustment of the length of the gathering chain as harvesting conditions change.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0062\" num=\"0061\">Alternatively, the gathering chain assembly can be automatically controlled. For example, as seen in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref> the gathering chain assembly can be operatively connected to one or more sensors <b>427</b> which detect changes in harvesting conditions about the forward end <b>403</b> of the row unit <b>420</b>. The sensor(s) <b>427</b> can be operatively connected to the actuator <b>407</b> via a controller or feedback control mechanism <b>429</b>. Constructed as such, the actuator <b>407</b> activates in response to output from the sensor(s) upon detecting a change in harvesting conditions. That is, the sensor(s) <b>427</b> gather data reflective of harvesting conditions and provide output which is received as input by the feedback control mechanism <b>429</b>. In turn, the feedback control mechanism, which is operatively connected to the sensor(s) <b>427</b> and the adjustment unit <b>405</b>, issues commands to the adjustment unit for causing the adjustment unit to move the endless chain responsive to changes in harvesting conditions detected by the sensor(s). Consequently, the feedback control mechanism <b>429</b> causes the motor <b>444</b> to move the actuator <b>407</b> to extend or retract as may be appropriate to accommodate changing harvesting conditions in real time. That is, the adjustment unit moves the endless chain between first and second positions, wherein in the first position the driven unit is at a first distance from the drive unit and in the second position the driven unit is at a second distance from the drive unit, wherein the second distance is less than the first distance.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0063\" num=\"0062\">Changing harvesting conditions that may be detected by the sensor(s) <b>427</b> can include the disposition of the crop being harvested, e.g., standing or down/lodged. However, the sensor(s) <b>427</b> may also be used to detect changes in operating parameters of the combine, such as the pressure on cleaning system. For example, the cleaning system pressure can be monitored for increases or decreases since the pressure on the cleaning system is based at least partly on the material other than grain (&#x201c;MOG&#x201d;) load on the system. Thus, in response to the detected pressure on the cleaning system, the gathering chain assembly can adjust to a position that takes in more or less material, e.g., a relatively forwardly extended or retracted position. Increased MOG intake also results in increased power burdens on the auger or rotor. Thus, increased or decreased power requirements may also be another condition that may be detected by the sensor(s) <b>427</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0064\" num=\"0063\">It will be further understood that, notwithstanding the ability to utilize automatic control of the gathering chain assembly adjustment mechanism, the human combine operator can override automatic control via use of controller <b>423</b> if he or she believes that automatic control is not well-suited to harvesting under certain crop conditions.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0065\" num=\"0064\">Additionally, although shown and described in connection with the header row unit <b>420</b> of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref>, it will be understood that the operator-controlled and automatically-controlled mechanisms <b>423</b> and <b>429</b> shown and described in connection with <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref> may be used with any of the of the gathering chain assemblies disclosed hereinabove and below.</p>\n",

Each gathering chain assembly <b>560</b> includes a drive unit or drive sprocket <b>552</b> and a driven unit assembly or driven sprocket assembly <b>554</b> spaced from and movable relative to the drive sprocket. An endless gathering chain <b>548</b> extends between and is entrained about the drive sprocket <b>552</b> and the driven sprocket assembly <b>554</b> whereby rotation of the drive sprocket causes rotation of the driven sprocket assembly.

The driven sprocket assembly <b>554</b> includes first and second sprockets carried about opposite ends of an arm pivotably connected to a frame of the gathering chain assembly such that the driven sprocket assembly pivots between a medial position (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref>) and a lateral position (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12</figref>). More specifically, each driven sprocket assembly <b>554</b> comprises a driven sprocket <b>554</b><i>a </i>and an idler sprocket <b>554</b><i>b </i>engaged with the gathering chain <b>548</b>.

      "<p id=\"p-0067\" num=\"0066\">An elongated stationary arm <b>557</b> having first and second ends <b>557</b><i>a </i>and <b>557</b><i>b</i>, respectively, is connected at its first end <b>557</b><i>a </i>to an unillustrated gathering chain assembly frame. Additionally, the first end <b>557</b><i>a </i>rotatably carries the drive sprocket <b>552</b>. The second end <b>557</b><i>b </i>of the stationary arm <b>557</b> is likewise connected to the gathering chain assembly frame and pivotably supports pivot arm <b>551</b> about a mid-region <b>553</b> thereof. So constructed and arranged, the pivot arm <b>551</b> is capable of pivoting or swinging in clockwise and counterclockwise directions (when viewed as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>) relative to the stationary arm <b>557</b>. As such, the idler sprocket <b>554</b><i>b </i>can be brought into engagement with either the side of the gathering chain between the drive sprocket <b>552</b> and the driven sprocket <b>554</b><i>a </i>proximal the crop receiving slot <b>540</b> or the side of the gathering chain between the drive sprocket and the driven sprocket distal to the crop receiving slot. That is, the idler sprocket can be pivotably positioned to engage the gathering chain about its medial side or its lateral side. The driven sprocket <b>554</b><i>a </i>is thus pivoted about a fixed point on the gathering chain assembly to move the gathering chain <b>548</b> between a first position proximate the centerline A of the row unit and a second position distal to the centerline A of the row unit. The pivot point is chosen in a way that the tension on the chain is best maintained for the required range of motion of the driven sprocket.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0067\">So constructed and arranged, the driven sprocket <b>554</b><i>a </i>of each gathering chain assembly <b>560</b> can be placed into a first position (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref>) wherein the entirety of the sides of the gathering chains on opposite sides of the crop receiving slot <b>540</b> extending between the drive and driven sprockets are straight and parallel. As shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13A</figref>, as the gathering chains are also angled downwardly and as the entire length of the gathering chains of the row unit define a narrow throat, the row unit is suited for harvesting down or lodged crop since the gathering chains pick up crop which is lower to the ground G. Additionally, the driven sprocket of each gathering chain assembly can be placed into a second position (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12</figref>) in which the driven sprocket <b>554</b><i>a </i>is moved laterally away from the crop receiving slot <b>540</b> or centerline A of the row unit such that only the aft portions of the sides of the gathering chains on opposite sides of the crop receiving slot are parallel. In this configuration the fore portions of the gathering chains define a wide throat region followed by a narrow throat region which is suited for harvesting standing crop since the narrow throat region is situated higher up from the ground G due to the downwardly angled configuration of the gathering chain assembly (see <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13B</figref>).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0068\">Although not illustrated, it will be understood that any suitable mechanical, electromechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic or manual actuators can be employed to move the pivot arm <b>551</b> between first and second positions, e.g., in clockwise and counterclockwise directions when viewed as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> in order to dispose the driven sprockets <b>554</b><i>a </i>into down/lodged or standing crop harvesting positions.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0069\">The subject application also provides methods for adjusting the position of a gathering chain assembly for a row unit of a header for an agricultural harvester to harvest both down/lodged crop and upright/standing crop. An exemplary but non-limitative method involves several acts. Initially, a first harvesting condition is sensed about a forward end of the row unit. Such sensing can be achieved either visually or by the aid of at least one sensor. Upon sensing the first harvesting condition, an endless gathering chain extending between the drive sprocket and the driven sprocket of a row unit is moved under manual or automatic control to a first position to establish a spaced apart first distance between the drive sprocket and the driven sprocket. Thereafter, a second harvesting condition is sensed about the forward end of the row unit, again either visually or via at least one sensor. Then, upon sensing the second harvesting condition, the gathering chain of the row unit is moved under manual or automatic control to a second position to establish a second spaced apart distance between the drive sprocket and the driven sprocket. The acts of moving the gathering chain between the first and second positions can include adjusting the position of an adjustment unit engaged with the gathering chain. The position of the adjusting unit can be adjusted by use of a manual, powered or automatically-controlled extendable and retractable member. Alternatively expressed, the side of the gathering chain opposite the row unit crop receiving slot can be laterally displaceable with respect to the drive sprocket. Hence, the gathering chain can be configured to have substantially parallel sides when the gathering chain is in a first or fully extended position (for example, when harvesting down/lodged crop or when sensor(s) detect relatively higher burden on the on the cleaning system or rotor) or substantially non-parallel sides when in a second or retracted position wherein the gathering chain is less than fully extended (for example, when harvesting standing/upright crop or when sensor(s) detect relatively lower burden on the on the cleaning system or rotor).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0070\">A further exemplary but non-limitative method of the subject application involves several acts. Initially, a first harvesting condition is sensed about a forward end of the row unit. Such sensing can be achieved either visually or by the aid of at least one sensor. Upon sensing the first harvesting condition, an endless gathering chain extending between the drive sprocket and the driven sprocket is moved under manual or automatic control to a first position to establish a first position of the driven sprocket relative to the drive sprocket. Thereafter, a second harvesting condition is sensed about the forward end of the row unit, again either visually or via at least one sensor. Finally, upon sensing the second harvesting condition, the gathering chain is moved under manual or automatic control to a second position to establish a second position of the driven sprocket relative to the drive sprocket. Thus, the driven sprocket is laterally displaceable with respect to the drive sprocket between the first and second positions. The acts of moving the gathering chain between the first and second positions can include adjusting the position of an adjustment unit engaged with the gathering chain. The position of the adjusting unit can be adjusted by use of a manual, powered or automatically-controlled extendable and retractable member.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0071\">In another exemplary method of the subject application, the act of extending and retracting the point of contact between the gathering chain and crop involves the acts of pivoting a driven sprocket about a fixed point on the gathering chain assembly to move the gathering chain between a first position and a second position. By way of example but not limitation, in the first position the driven sprocket is disposed proximate a centerline of the row unit and in a second position the driven sprocket is disposed distal to the centerline of the row unit. Hence, the inner sides of the opposed gathering chains closest to the crop receiving slot are configured to be substantially parallel for the entire distance between the drive sprockets and the driven sprockets. In this configuration, the driven sprockets are in the first position to define a continuous narrow crop receiving throat (for example, when harvesting down/lodged crop or when sensor(s) detect relatively higher burden on the on the cleaning system or rotor) that is closer to the ground due to the sloped configuration of the row unit, as shown e.g., in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13A</figref>. In the alternative, the inner sides of the opposed gathering chains are configured to be at least partially non-parallel between the drive sprockets and the driven sprockets when the driven sprockets are in the second position to define a wide crop receiving throat portion followed by a narrow throat portion (for example, when harvesting standing/upright crop or when sensor(s) detect relatively lower burden on the on the cleaning system or rotor). In this configuration, the gathering chain engages crop into position higher up from the ground e.g., as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13B</figref>. It will be understood, however, that the terms &#x201c;first position&#x201d; and &#x201c;second position&#x201d; as used in the example above are for illustrative purposes only. That is, the starting position of the driven sprocket relative to the drive sprocket may be opposite to that described above, in which case the &#x201c;first position&#x201d; may correspond to the &#x201c;second position,&#x201d; and vice versa.</p>\n",

      "<heading id=\"h-0001\" level=\"1\">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0002\" num=\"0001\">The present invention relates to agricultural harvesters such as combines, and, more particularly, to a sieve attitude control in cleaning systems used in such combines.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">An agricultural harvester known as a &#x201c;combine&#x201d; is historically termed such because it combines multiple harvesting functions with a single harvesting unit, such as picking, threshing, separating and cleaning. A combine includes a header which removes the crop from a field, and a feeder housing which transports the crop matter into a threshing rotor. The threshing rotor rotates within a perforated housing, which may be in the form of adjustable concaves and performs a threshing operation on the crop to remove the grain. Once the grain is threshed it falls through perforations in the concaves onto a grain pan. From the grain pan the grain is cleaned using a cleaning system, and is then transported to a grain tank onboard the combine. A cleaning fan blows air through the sieves to discharge chaff and other debris toward the rear of the combine. Non-grain crop material, such as straw, from the threshing section proceeds through a residue system, which may utilize a straw chopper to process the non-grain material and direct it out the rear of the combine. When the grain tank becomes full, the combine is positioned adjacent a vehicle into which the grain is to be unloaded, such as a semi-trailer, gravity box, straight truck, or the like; and an unloading system on the combine is actuated to transfer the grain into the vehicle.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">More particularly, a rotary threshing or separating system includes one or more rotors which can extend axially (front to rear) or transversely within the body of the combine, and which are partially or fully surrounded by a perforated concave. The crop material is threshed and separated by the rotation of the rotor within the concave. Coarser non-grain crop material such as stalks and leaves are transported to the rear of the combine and discharged back to the field. The separated grain, together with some finer non-grain crop material such as chaff, dust, straw, and other crop residue are discharged through the concaves and fall onto a grain pan where they are transported to a cleaning system. Alternatively, the grain and finer non-grain crop material may also fall directly onto the cleaning system itself.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">A cleaning system further separates the grain from non-grain crop material, and typically includes a fan directing an airflow stream upwardly and rearwardly through vertically arranged sieves which oscillate in a fore and aft manner. The airflow stream lifts and carries the lighter non-grain crop material towards the rear end of the combine for discharge to the field. Clean grain, being heavier, and larger pieces of non-grain crop material, which are not carried away by the airflow stream, fall onto a surface of an upper sieve (also known as a chaffer sieve) where some or all of the clean grain passes through to a lower sieve (also known as a cleaning sieve). Grain and non-grain crop material remaining on the upper and lower sieves are physically separated by the reciprocating action of the sieves as the material moves rearwardly. Any grain and/or non-grain crop material remaining on the top surface of the upper sieve are discharged at the rear of the combine. Grain falling through the lower sieve lands on a bottom pan of the cleaning system, where it is conveyed forwardly toward a clean grain auger.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">During the cleaning operation crop material that lands on the sieves from the threshing system may be randomly distributed. However, often the operation of the threshing system can bias where the crop material lands on the sieves. For example, if a clump of some sort occurs between the rotor and the concaves, then the material flow through the concaves is altered and hence the distribution of the material on the sieves is affected. The rotation of the rotor itself and variations in the speed of the rotor will impart variations in the movement of crop material through the concaves, which also serves to alter the distribution of crop material on the sieves.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">The cleaning systems of prior art harvesters have certain adjustments that can be made, which for the most part are static during the harvesting operation.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">What is needed in the art is a dynamic sieve control system that reduces grain loss in the cleaning system as the combine is harvesting crops.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0002\" level=\"1\">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">The present invention provides a system and method of redistributing crop material after it falls onto a grain sieve in an agricultural harvester.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">The invention in one form is directed to a cleaning section of an agricultural harvester, the cleaning section including a sieve, a plurality of load sensors, and a sieve slope compensating system. The sieve is positioned in the harvester to receive crop material from a threshing section. The plurality of load sensors are coupled to the sieve. The load sensors are configured to produce signals representative of a distributed load of the crop material on the sieve. The sieve slope compensating system is configured to tilt and/or alter the shaking of the sieve dependent upon the signals.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">The invention in another form is directed to a method of altering a lateral tilt or sideways movement of a sieve in a cleaning section of an agricultural harvester. The method includes the steps of detecting an imbalance in the distributed load on a sieve; and actuating at least one actuator to laterally tilt and/or shake the sieve dependent upon the detected imbalance.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\">The present invention advantageously improves the cleaning capacity of the cleaning system by redistributing the crop material on the sieve.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\">Another advantage of the present invention is that it reduces grain loss.</p>\n",

      "<heading id=\"h-0004\" level=\"1\">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0023\" num=\"0022\">The terms &#x201c;grain&#x201d;, &#x201c;straw&#x201d; and &#x201c;tailings&#x201d; are used principally throughout this specification for convenience but it is to be understood that these terms are not intended to be limiting. Thus &#x201c;grain&#x201d; refers to that part of the crop material which is threshed and separated from the discardable part of the crop material, which is referred to as non-grain crop material, MOG or straw. Incompletely threshed crop material is referred to as &#x201c;tailings&#x201d;. Also the terms &#x201c;forward&#x201d;, &#x201c;rearward&#x201d;, &#x201c;left&#x201d; and &#x201c;right&#x201d;, when used in connection with the agricultural harvester and/or components thereof are usually determined with reference to the direction of forward operative travel of the harvester, but again, they should not be construed as limiting. The terms &#x201c;longitudinal&#x201d; and &#x201c;transverse&#x201d; are determined with reference to the fore-and-aft direction of the agricultural harvester and are equally not to be construed as limiting.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0024\" num=\"0023\">Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown an agricultural harvester in the form of a combine <b>10</b>, which generally includes a chassis <b>12</b>, ground engaging wheels <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, a header <b>18</b>, a feeder housing <b>20</b>, an operator cab <b>22</b>, a threshing and separating system <b>24</b>, a cleaning system <b>26</b>, a grain tank <b>28</b>, and an unloading auger <b>30</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0025\" num=\"0024\">The front wheels <b>14</b> are larger flotation type wheels, and the rear wheels <b>16</b> are smaller steerable wheels. Motive force is selectively applied to the front wheels <b>14</b> through a power plant in the form of a diesel engine <b>32</b> and a transmission (not shown). Although the combine <b>10</b> is shown as including wheels, is also to be understood that the combine <b>10</b> may include tracks, such as full tracks or half-tracks.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0026\" num=\"0025\">The header <b>18</b> is mounted to the front of the combine <b>10</b> and includes a cutter bar <b>34</b> for severing crops from a field during forward motion of the combine <b>10</b>. A rotatable reel <b>36</b> feeds the crop into the header <b>18</b>, and a double auger <b>38</b> feeds the severed crop laterally inwardly from each side toward the feeder housing <b>20</b>. The feeder housing <b>20</b> conveys the cut crop to the threshing and separating system <b>24</b>, and is selectively vertically movable using appropriate actuators, such as hydraulic cylinders (not shown).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0027\" num=\"0026\">The threshing and separating system <b>24</b> is of the axial-flow type, and generally includes a rotor <b>40</b> at least partially enclosed by and rotatable within a corresponding perforated concave <b>42</b>. The cut crops are threshed and separated by the rotation of the rotor <b>40</b> within the concave <b>42</b>, and larger elements, such as stalks, leaves and the like are discharged from the rear of the combine <b>10</b>. Smaller elements of crop material including grain and non-grain crop material, including particles lighter than grain, such as chaff, dust and straw, are discharged through perforations of the concave <b>42</b>. Although the threshing and separating system <b>24</b> is illustrated as being of an axial-flow type having a rotor, it is also contemplated to use the present invention with other conventional threshing systems.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0028\" num=\"0027\">Grain which has been separated by the threshing and separating assembly <b>24</b> falls onto a grain pan <b>44</b> and is conveyed toward the cleaning system <b>26</b>. The cleaning system <b>26</b> may include an optional pre-cleaning sieve <b>46</b>, an upper sieve <b>48</b> (also known as a chaffer sieve), a lower sieve <b>50</b> (also known as a cleaning sieve), and a cleaning fan <b>52</b>. Grain on the sieves <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> is subjected to a cleaning action by the fan <b>52</b> which provides an airflow through the sieves to remove chaff and other impurities such as dust from the grain by making this material airborne for discharge from the straw hood <b>54</b> of the combine <b>10</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0029\" num=\"0028\">The grain pan <b>44</b> and the pre-cleaning sieve <b>46</b> oscillate in a fore-to-aft manner to transport the grain and finer non-grain crop material to the upper surface of the upper sieve <b>48</b>. The upper sieve <b>48</b> and the lower sieve <b>50</b> are vertically arranged relative to each other, and likewise oscillate in a fore-to-aft manner to spread the grain across the sieves <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, while permitting the passage of cleaned grain by gravity through the openings of the sieves <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0030\" num=\"0029\">Clean grain falls to a clean grain auger <b>56</b> positioned crosswise below and in front of the lower sieve <b>50</b>. The clean grain auger <b>56</b> receives clean grain from each sieve <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> and from the bottom pan <b>58</b> of the cleaning system <b>26</b>. The clean grain auger <b>56</b> conveys the clean grain laterally to a generally vertically arranged grain elevator <b>60</b> for transport to the grain tank <b>28</b>. Tailings from the cleaning system <b>26</b> fall to a tailings auger trough <b>62</b>. The tailings are transported via the tailings auger <b>64</b> and the return auger <b>66</b> to the upstream end of the cleaning system <b>26</b> for repeated cleaning action. A pair of grain tank augers <b>68</b> at the bottom of the grain tank <b>28</b> convey the clean grain laterally within the grain tank <b>28</b> to the unloading auger <b>30</b> for discharge from the combine <b>10</b>.</p>\n",

As crop material <b>72</b> falls from the threshing and separating system <b>24</b> onto the grain pan <b>44</b> and the pre-cleaning sieve <b>46</b>, the crop material <b>72</b> is distributed in a manner that is prejudiced by the actions of the threshing and separating system <b>24</b>, and by the random nature of the crop material <b>72</b> itself. The distribution of the crop material <b>72</b> will vary as grain leaves the non-grain material, and as the crop material <b>72</b> moves in a crop material movement direction <b>74</b>. For purposes of explaining the present invention, it will be discussed as being applied to the sieve <b>48</b>, although it is to be understood that the present invention may be applied to other sieves in combine <b>10</b>, and can be applied to more than one sieve at a time, or even to the grain pan <b>44</b>. The sensor can be placed in the fall step at the end of the grain pan <b>44</b> to sense the resistance that the air experiences as it flows through the fall step at the end of the grain pan to grain pan (pre blowing) or the grain pan <b>44</b> to the sieve <b>48</b>.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0034\" num=\"0033\">The distribution of the crop material <b>72</b> on the sieve <b>48</b> is detected and altered by a sieve slope compensating system <b>90</b> that uses load sensors, such as pressure sensors <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> and <b>82</b>, illustrated in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> in a schematic fashion, on a schematically illustrated version of the sieve <b>48</b>. The pressure sensors <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> produce signals representative of the combined weight of the sieve <b>48</b> and the crop material <b>72</b>. The signals, more importantly, provide the information on the distribution of the crop material <b>72</b>, in the form of pressure readings, and more specifically the difference in the readings, which indicate the left-right distribution of the crop material <b>72</b> on the sieve <b>48</b>. The air pressure underneath the sieves <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> is a result of the wind coming from the cleaning fan <b>52</b>, the size of the openings in the sieves <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> and the amount of crop material lying on top of the sieves <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>. The more crop is lying on the sieves <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, the more resistance the air from the cleaning fan <b>52</b> will experience when blowing through the sieves <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>. Uneven crop distributions will thus result in pressure differences between different locations underneath the sieves <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> and the pressure sensors <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> will provide an accurate indication of the crop distribution. Although the embodiments described below use pressure sensors <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> for measuring the crop distribution, also other types of sensors will be suitable for the same purpose. Load sensors for measuring the crop distribution on the sieves <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> or the grain pan <b>44</b> may, e.g., be embodied as impact sensors, wind-speed sensors, sonar or radar. Also sensors for measuring the layer thickness of the crop layer at different positions on the sieves <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> can be used for this purpose.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0035\" num=\"0034\">The sieve slope compensating system <b>90</b> additionally includes a controller <b>84</b>, an actuator <b>86</b> and sensors <b>88</b>. The sensors <b>88</b> may be in the form of impact sensors. The signals are received by the controller <b>84</b>, which is in communication with the pressure sensors <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> and with the actuator <b>86</b> that is configured to laterally tilt the sieve <b>48</b> or to alter a side shaking movement, such as the amplitude, of the sieve <b>48</b> to thereby alter the distribution of the crop material <b>72</b>. The pressure sensors <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> can be thought of as two pairs of pressure sensors, <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> and <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, with the pair <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> being closest to the end of the sieve <b>48</b> where the crop material <b>72</b> first contacts the sieve <b>48</b>. The pressure sensors <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> may have their signals combined to produce a single difference signal, which signals an imbalance in the weight distribution from a lateral perspective. This combined signal is received by the controller <b>84</b>, and the controller <b>84</b> sends a command to the actuator <b>86</b> to laterally tilt the sieve <b>48</b> so as to predictively alter the distribution of the crop material <b>72</b> on the sieve <b>48</b>. The pressure sensors <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> may each include a resilient deformable tube that is coupled to selected portions of the sieve <b>48</b> with the fluid or gas pressure therein varying as the weight of the distribution of the crop material <b>72</b> varies on the sieve <b>48</b>. The variation in pressure in the tubes are detected and used to create the signals sent to the controller <b>84</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0035\">While the crop material <b>72</b> is generally moving in the direction <b>74</b>, the crop material <b>72</b> may also take on some lateral movement, due to the lateral tilting or shaking of the sieve <b>48</b>, so as to improve the distribution of the crop material <b>72</b> as it moves along the sieve <b>48</b>. The movement of the crop material <b>72</b> is not uniform and the lateral movement of some portions of the crop material <b>72</b> causes a spreading of the crop material <b>72</b> on the sieve <b>48</b>. The pressure sensors <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> are positioned proximate to the end of the sieve <b>48</b> in the crop material movement direction <b>74</b> allowing a measurement of the distribution of the crop material <b>72</b> close to the end of travel along the sieve <b>48</b>, and hence a measure of the effectiveness of the lateral tilt. Another measure of effectiveness may be undertaken with a set of sensors <b>88</b> that may be impact sensors, which measure a distribution of either grain passing through the sieve <b>48</b> or the impact of the crop material that leaves the end of the sieve <b>48</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0037\" num=\"0036\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a percentage of grain loss along a vertical axis and a measured pressure difference on a set of the pressure sensors <b>76</b> and <b>78</b>; and/or <b>80</b> and <b>82</b>. The pressure difference, here illustrated as an approximate &#x2212;50 mV signal, which is representative of a slight pressure difference, in this example, results in an optimized low grain loss. The actual value and units of the value are representative and only used as an illustration. This value is provided as an example, and is not intended to establish a baseline value. It is understood that lateral tilting or shaking of the sieve <b>48</b> to the left and right (as needed) is undertaken to result in the optimized distribution of the crop material <b>72</b>. The tilting or shaking of the sieve <b>48</b> is carried out by the actuator <b>86</b> under the direction of the controller <b>84</b>. The controller <b>84</b> uses an algorithm that accounts for the variations that may occur in the distribution of the crop material <b>72</b> that falls onto the sieve <b>48</b> and how the crop material <b>72</b> moves laterally in response to an attitude change carried out by the actuator <b>86</b>. The sieve slope compensating system <b>90</b> may give preference to the signals coming from the pressure sensors <b>76</b> and <b>78</b>, since they are close to the area where the crop material <b>72</b> first contacts the sieve <b>48</b>, with the signals from the pressure sensors <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> being used to evaluate the effectiveness of actions taken by the sieve slope compensating system <b>90</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\">The lateral angle of the sieve <b>48</b> is controlled based on the detection of an unbalance in the amount of material <b>72</b> along the width of the sieve <b>48</b>. By controlling the lateral sieve angle the material <b>72</b> becomes evenly spread on the sieves and the maximum sieve potential is used, which results in an increased cleaning capacity. The detection of the unbalance is accomplished with sensors, such as the pressure sensors (<b>76</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>) described above, or by way of impact sensors, wind-speed sensors, sonar or radar to measure the crop distribution on the sieve <b>48</b> or the grain pan <b>44</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\">A problem in the prior art that the present invention addresses will now be further discussed. A difference in the load between the left and the right side of the sieves can be the result of the rotor, or other threshing and separation units, dropping more of the crop material <b>72</b> to one side of the cleaning system <b>26</b>. Further, more material may be fed to the threshing and separating system <b>24</b> with a similar unbalanced crop material distribution resulting. A bad lateral sieve calibration or the lateral combine slope can also be a contributing factor for a material imbalance and hence to degraded cleaning system performance. When the crop material <b>72</b> on the sieves is not equally distributed over the width of the sieve <b>48</b>, the cleaning capacity decreases. The airflow is not able to blow to one side of the cleaning system <b>26</b>, due to there being too much material causing a portion of the sieve <b>48</b> to be blocked and the airflow escapes at the other side of the sieve <b>48</b> resulting in a blow out situation. The cleaning capacity is decreased and cleaning losses occur.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\">The present invention detects an unbalanced situation upon the upper sieve and the lateral angle of the upper sieve is adapted. This is done with a feedback control carried out by the controller <b>84</b>, where the unbalance is the feedback parameter. In this way a certain unbalance can be set so that the control doesn't react in an unstable manner. Now, two methods will be discussed to detect the unbalance. Other methods to determine a left-right unbalance are also contemplated. The first method uses the pressure sensors <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> that are positioned right underneath the sieve <b>48</b>. The pressure sensors <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> are positioned in the last 50 cm of the sieve <b>48</b>, so that they detect the unbalance at the back of the sieve <b>48</b>. The pressure sensors <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> have to be placed on both sides (the left and the right sides) of the sieve <b>48</b>. If the measured pressure on one side is higher than on the other side, it means that there is more crop material <b>72</b> upon the sieve <b>48</b> on that side. If the measured pressure difference between the left and right is high enough, an alteration of the lateral sieve angle or a change in the side movement of the sieve <b>48</b> to throw the crop material <b>72</b> on the sieve <b>48</b> to the more unloaded side is undertaken by the sieve slope compensating system <b>90</b> to solve the imbalance.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\">The second method uses two impact sensors <b>88</b> at the back of the cleaning section <b>26</b>. The sensors <b>88</b> are placed in a way so that they detect the sieve off losses. The signals of the two sensors <b>88</b> are constantly compared. When one signal becomes higher than the other, it means that there is more crop on that side and there is an unbalanced condition on the upper sieve. The controller <b>84</b> decides whether the difference is big enough to react and to adapt the lateral sieve angle. In both situations the set-point of the system may be a difference of 0, so that there is no unbalance.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\">The above discussed approaches can restore the balance of the crop material <b>72</b> upon the sieve <b>48</b> so that the total surface of the sieve <b>48</b> is used in a more efficient manner. This will advantageously result in increased cleaning capacity. On single rotor machines the increase in capacity may be the largest. Current manual lateral sieve offset can now be replaced by the present invention acting upon the true measured imbalance rather then a factory open loop offset setting.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\">The present invention has certain advantages including improved cleaning system performance allowing the cleaning system <b>26</b> to be able to more effectively separate grain from material other than grain.</p>\n",

      "<heading id=\"h-0001\" level=\"1\">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0002\" num=\"0001\">The present invention relates to agricultural balers, and, more particularly, to systems for powering such balers.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0002\" level=\"1\">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">Agricultural harvesting machines, such as balers, are used to consolidate and package crop material so as to facilitate the storage and handling of the crop material for later use. In the case of hay, a mower-conditioner is typically used to cut and condition the crop material for windrow drying in the sun. In the case of straw, an agricultural combine discharges non-grain crop material from the rear of the combine defining the straw (such as wheat or oat straw) which is to be picked up by the baler. The cut crop material is typically raked and dried, and a baler, such as a large square baler or round baler, straddles the windrows and travels along the windrows to pick up the crop material and form it into bales.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">On a large square baler, a pickup unit at the front of the baler gathers the cut and windrowed crop material from the ground. The pickup unit includes a pickup roll, and optionally may include other components such as side shields, stub augers, wind guard, etc.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">A packer unit is used to move the crop material from the pickup unit to a duct or pre-compression chamber. The packer unit forms a wad of crop within the pre-compression chamber which is then transferred to a main bale chamber. (For purposes of discussion, the charge of crop material within the pre-compression chamber will be termed a &#x201c;wad&#x201d;, and the charge of crop material after being compressed within the main bale chamber will be termed a &#x201c;flake&#x201d;). Typically such a packer unit includes packer tines or forks to move the crop material from the pickup unit into the pre-compression chamber. Instead of a packer unit it is also known to use a rotor cutter unit which chops the crop material into smaller pieces.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">A stuffer unit transfers the wad of crop material in charges from the pre-compression chamber to the main bale chamber. Typically such a stuffer unit includes stuffer forks which are used to move the wad of crop material from the pre-compression chamber to the main bale chamber, in sequence with the reciprocating action of a plunger within the main bale chamber.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">In the main bale chamber, the plunger compresses the wad of crop material into flakes to form a bale and, at the same time, gradually advances the bale toward the outlet of the bale chamber. The plunger reciprocates, back and forth, toward and away from the discharge end of the baler. The plunger may include a number of rollers which extend laterally outward from the sides of the plunger. The rollers on each side of the plunger are received within a respective plunger slot formed in the side walls of the bale chamber, with the plunger slots guiding the plunger during the reciprocating movements.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">When enough flakes have been added and the bale reaches a full (or other predetermined) size, a number of knotters are actuated which wrap and tie twine, cord or the like around the bale while it is still in the main bale chamber. The twine is cut and the formed baled is ejected out the back of the baler as a new bale is formed.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">During a compression cycle of the plunger as described above, the plunger moves through a compression stroke as it advances into the main bale chamber, with the highest load on the plunger occurring at the end of each compression stroke. As balers become increasingly larger, the peak loads on the plunger during compression strokes likewise become increasingly larger. One way to compensate for these higher peak loads is to use a larger flywheel coupled with a gearbox which drives the plunger. As the plunger reaches the end of the compression stroke, the momentum of the heavier flywheel helps carry the plunger through the peak load at the end of the compression stroke. If the flywheel is not heavy enough then high loads are transferred back through the driveline to the base unit, which can result in lugging down of the engine onboard the base unit. However, a flywheel which is too large is also undesirable since it typically requires a base unit with a larger horsepower (HP) rating to start and drive the flywheel forming part of the driveline of the baler.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">US 2010/0108413 describes a baler having a jog drive system drivingly connected within the primary drive system. This jog drive system serves as a source of power to the various performance systems in the baler when movement of components within the baler is required for maintenance or adjustment. The jog drive system comprises a jog motor which can be in the form of a hydraulic motor, an electric motor or other suitable drive mechanism for slowly rotating the flywheel of the baler and thereby advancing all performance systems. The jog motor can be connected to a hydraulic system of the tractor, to an electric system of the tractor or can be provided with other sources of power input. This jog drive system is foreseen to assist the operator when maintenance or adjustment is needed to the baler, and does not have an impact on the operation of the plunger, since the jog drive system is only able to slowly rotate the flywheel.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">In EP 1 974 601, a similar auxiliary drive is foreseen which functions as a starting arrangement acting on the main drive of the baler and which is capable of acting as a sole drive of the baler or as a drive assisting the main drive in the first phase of the process of starting the baler. During the starting process, the main drive will accelerate to a higher speed than the auxiliary drive by means of a freewheel arrangement, whereupon the auxiliary drive ceases to have any effect on the remainder of the starting process. This auxiliary drive is used to overcome the problem that sometimes it is difficult to start up the baler and will assist only during this start-up phase, after which it ceases to have any effect.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\">What is needed in the art is an agricultural baler which accommodates large intermittent loads during operation of the baler.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0003\" level=\"1\">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\">The present invention provides an agricultural baler with an auxiliary power system (APS) which scavenges power from a rotationally or linearly movable component of the baler and stores the power for subsequent use.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0014\" num=\"0013\">The invention in one form is directed to an agricultural baler including a flywheel, a driveline associated with the flywheel and couplable with a power take-off (PTO) of a fraction unit, and a movable component which is driven directly or indirectly by the driveline and movable in a linear and/or rotational manner. The baler is characterized by an auxiliary power system coupled with the movable component. The auxiliary power system is configured for receiving power from the movable component and storing the power.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0015\" num=\"0014\">An advantage of the present invention is that power is scavenged from at least one movable component which is directly or indirectly driven by the driveline of the baler.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0016\" num=\"0015\">Another advantage is that the power can be scavenged/harvested during off-peak load periods of the plunger duty cycle.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0017\" num=\"0016\">Yet another advantage is that the stored power can be used for various purposes, such as being transmitted back to the driveline to flatten out the load requirements on the driveline, or used to power auxiliary components such as lights, fans, motors, processors, etc.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0018\" num=\"0017\">A further advantage is that the energy from the movable components(s) is captured in the form of stored energy, and thereby avoids heat generation onboard the baler.</p>\n",

      "<heading id=\"h-0005\" level=\"1\">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0028\" num=\"0027\">Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a perspective cutaway view showing the internal workings of a large square baler <b>10</b>. Baler <b>10</b> operates on a two stage feeding system. Crop material is lifted from windrows into the baler <b>10</b> using a pickup unit <b>12</b>. The pickup unit <b>12</b> includes a rotating pickup roll <b>14</b> with tines <b>16</b> which move the crop rearward toward a packer unit <b>18</b>. An optional pair of stub augers (one of which is shown, but not numbered) are positioned above the pickup roll <b>14</b> to move the crop material laterally inward. The packer unit <b>18</b> includes packer tines <b>20</b> which push the crop into a pre-compression chamber <b>22</b> to form a wad of crop material. The packer tines <b>20</b> intertwine the crop together and pack the crop within the pre-compression chamber <b>22</b>. Pre-compression chamber <b>22</b> and packer tines <b>20</b> function as the first stage for crop compression. Once the pressure in the pre-compression chamber <b>22</b> reaches a predetermined sensed value, a stuffer unit <b>24</b> moves the wad of crop from the pre-compression chamber <b>22</b> to a main bale chamber <b>26</b>. The stuffer unit <b>24</b> includes stuffer forks <b>28</b> which thrust the wad of crop directly in front of a plunger <b>30</b>, which reciprocates within the main bale chamber <b>26</b> and compresses the wad of crop into a flake. Stuffer forks <b>28</b> return to their original stationary state after the wad of material has been moved into the main bale chamber <b>26</b>. Plunger <b>30</b> compresses the wads of crop into flakes to form a bale and, at the same time, gradually advances the bale toward outlet <b>32</b> of main bale chamber <b>26</b>. Main bale chamber <b>26</b> and plunger <b>30</b> function as the second stage for crop compression. When enough flakes have been added and the bale reaches a full (or other predetermined) size, knotters <b>34</b> are actuated which wrap and tie twine around the bale while it is still in the main bale chamber <b>26</b>. Needles <b>36</b> bring the lower twine up to the knotters <b>34</b> and the tying process then takes place. The twine is cut and the formed bale is ejected from a discharge chute <b>38</b> as a new bale is formed.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0029\" num=\"0028\">Plunger <b>30</b> is connected via a crank arm <b>40</b> with a gear box <b>42</b>. Gear box <b>42</b> is driven by a flywheel <b>44</b>, which in turn is connected via a drive shaft <b>46</b> with the power take-off (PTO) coupler <b>48</b>. The PTO coupler <b>48</b> is detachably connected with the PTO spline at the rear of the traction unit, such as a tractor (not shown). PTO coupler <b>48</b>, drive shaft <b>46</b> and flywheel <b>44</b> together define a portion of a driveline <b>50</b> which provides rotative power to gearbox <b>42</b>. Flywheel <b>44</b> has a sufficient mass to carry plunger <b>30</b> through a compression stroke as power is applied to drive shaft <b>46</b> by the traction unit. Without the flywheel, a large mechanical load (impulse) is placed on the traction unit as peak power is required by the baler during operation, such as at the end of a compression stroke and/or during a stuffer unit stroke. Generally speaking, as balers become increasingly larger the size of the flywheel also becomes increasingly larger. A larger flywheel also in turn typically requires the use of a traction unit with a higher horsepower rating, to maintain input power to the drive shaft <b>46</b> during operation, and since higher power is required to start rotation of the flywheel from an at-rest position.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0030\" num=\"0029\">Referring now to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, conjunctively, baler <b>10</b> also includes an auxiliary power system (APS) <b>52</b> which is coupled with the driveline <b>50</b> in parallel with the flywheel <b>44</b>, in a mechanical power distribution sense and not necessarily a geometric sense. The APS <b>52</b> generally functions to receive power from the driveline <b>50</b>, store the power, and transmit the stored power back to the driveline <b>50</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0031\" num=\"0030\">APS <b>52</b> generally includes a power generation device <b>54</b> for receiving power from the driveline <b>50</b> and generating power, a power storage device <b>56</b> coupled with and storing power from the power generation device <b>54</b>, and a power feedback device <b>58</b> for transmitting the stored power back to the driveline. In the block diagram shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, the power generation device <b>54</b> and the power feedback device <b>58</b> are configured as the same unit which can operate with different functionality, such as a hydraulic pump/motor or an electric motor/generator. When configured as a hydraulic pump/motor, the power storage device <b>56</b> can be in the form of one or more hydraulic accumulators. Alternatively, when configured as an electric motor/generator, the power storage device <b>56</b> can be in the form of one or more ultracapacitors and/or batteries. With this type of dual functionality, the power storage device <b>56</b> is connected with the power generation device <b>54</b>/power feedback device <b>58</b> in a bidirectional manner allowing 2-way flow of power, as indicated by double headed arrow <b>60</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0032\" num=\"0031\">Alternatively, the power generation device <b>54</b> and the power feedback device <b>58</b> can be separate and discrete units which are each coupled with the driveline <b>50</b> and power storage device <b>56</b>. For example, the power generation device <b>54</b> can be in the form of a hydraulic pump, and the power feedback device <b>58</b> can be in the form of a separate hydraulic motor, each of which are mechanically coupled with the driveline <b>50</b> and hydraulically coupled with a power storage device in the form of an accumulator (not specifically shown). Moreover, the power generation device <b>54</b> can be in the form of an electric motor, and the power feedback device <b>58</b> can be in the form of a separate electric generator, each of which are mechanically coupled with the driveline <b>50</b> and electrically coupled with a power storage device <b>56</b> in the form of an ultracapacitor and/or battery (not specifically shown).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0033\" num=\"0032\">The power storage device <b>56</b> shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref> can also be configured differently than one or more hydraulic accumulators, ultracapacitors and/or batteries. For example, the power storage device <b>56</b> can be configured as an additional mechanical flywheel which receives/transmits power from/to the driveline <b>50</b>. The power generation device <b>54</b> and the power feedback device <b>58</b> can be configured as a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and the additional flywheel would somehow be capable of receiving and storing power during off-peak load periods and transferring the power back to the driveline <b>50</b> for use during peak load periods.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0034\" num=\"0033\">For purposes of discussion hereinafter, it will be assumed that the power generation device <b>54</b> and the power feedback device <b>58</b> are in the form of a singular unit configured as a hydraulic pump/motor. Pump/motor <b>54</b>, <b>58</b> is coupled with and under the control of an electrical processing circuit <b>62</b>, which can be in the form of an electronic control unit (ECU) or an analog processor. Electrical processing circuit <b>62</b> can be a dedicated ECU onboard the baler <b>10</b>, or can also be part of an ECU used for other purposes onboard the baler <b>10</b>. Alternatively, electrical processing circuit <b>62</b> can also be an ECU onboard the traction unit which tows the baler <b>10</b>, and can be coupled with the pump/motor <b>54</b>, <b>58</b> and other components onboard baler <b>10</b> in a wired or wireless manner.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0035\" num=\"0034\">Electrical processing circuit <b>62</b> controls operation of pump/motor <b>54</b>, <b>58</b> in a manner such that power is transmitted to the driveline <b>50</b> prior to and during peak load periods on the baler <b>10</b>, and power is received from the driveline <b>50</b> during off-peak load periods on the baler <b>10</b>. More specifically, power is transmitted to/from the driveline <b>50</b> dependent upon a position of the plunger <b>30</b> within the main bale chamber <b>26</b>, and/or a variable associated with the formation of a slice of crop material within the bale chamber <b>26</b>. To this end, the electrical processing circuit <b>62</b> is connected with one or more sensors <b>64</b> which provide output signals indicative of the position of the plunger <b>30</b> and/or a crop slice variable. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, the sensor <b>64</b> is positioned adjacent to flywheel <b>44</b> to determine the rotational position of the flywheel <b>44</b>, such as by using a proximity sensor, optical sensor, etc. The position of the flywheel <b>44</b> can in turn be used to establish the position of the plunger <b>30</b> within the main bale chamber <b>26</b>. Alternatively, the sensor <b>64</b> can be configured to sense a variable associated with crop slice formation within the main bale chamber <b>26</b>. Examples of crop slice formation variables may include a moisture content of the crop material, a thickness of a given slice of crop material and/or a positional change of the plunger at maximum compression for each slice of the crop material. Alternatively, the variable associated with the crop slice formation can even be input by a user, such as a particular type of crop material being harvested. Other input variables may also be used for controlling operation of APS <b>52</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0035\">Referring now to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>, there is shown a control schematic of the APS <b>52</b> shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. APS <b>52</b> can be thought of as defining a hydraulic flywheel which is based on an over-center variable displacement pump/motor <b>54</b>, <b>58</b> connected between the accumulator <b>56</b> and a tank <b>66</b>. In order to avoid any overpressure, a pressure relief valve <b>68</b> is installed between the pump/motor <b>54</b>, <b>58</b> and the accumulator <b>56</b>. A check valve <b>70</b> is also connected to the tank <b>66</b> in order to avoid cavitation of the pump/motor <b>54</b>, <b>58</b>. A pressure transducer <b>72</b> is used to manage the displacement of the pump/motor <b>54</b>, <b>58</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0037\" num=\"0036\">Basically, during a typical duty cycle, the pump/motor <b>54</b>, <b>58</b> works as a real pump charging the accumulator <b>56</b> when the instant power of the baler <b>10</b> is lower than the average power (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>). On the other hand, when the plunger <b>30</b> is in a compressing stroke, the pump/motor <b>54</b>, <b>58</b> works as a motor converting hydraulic power into mechanical power that can be provided to the driveline <b>50</b>. In this way, the typical peak power can be avoided and the PTO power provided from the tractor is always close to the average power. The pump size is a function of the maximum pressure in the accumulator <b>56</b> and the operating speed of the pump/motor <b>54</b>, <b>58</b>. Because of the additional gearbox <b>74</b> coupled with the driveline <b>50</b>, the pump speed can be increased, e.g., from 1000 RPM (the typical PTO speed during working conditions) up to approximately 2680 RPM. This higher speed allows the use of a smaller pump with a higher hydraulic efficiency and faster response time, in contrast with a larger pump needed when operating at a lower speed condition.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\">According to another aspect of the present invention, the APS <b>52</b> can be connected to and driven by one or more movable components <b>100</b> of baler <b>10</b> other than the driveline <b>50</b> (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>). The baler <b>10</b> includes many other movable components <b>100</b> that move either in an intermittent or continuous basis. Some of these movable components move in a rotational manner, such as drive or driven shafts, while others move in a linear manner, such as the plunger <b>30</b> as it reciprocates within the main bale chamber <b>26</b>. The APS <b>52</b> can harvest energy from these various movable components <b>100</b> and store the energy for specific purposes, such as transferring power back to the driveline <b>50</b> or powering auxiliary components such as lights, fans, motors, etc. onboard the baler <b>10</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>, the movable component <b>100</b> is assumed to be a rotatable shaft onboard the baler <b>10</b>, as indicated by direction arrow <b>102</b>. The rotatable shaft can be located at various places on the baler <b>10</b>, such as a rotatable shaft <b>100</b>A associated with the stuffer unit <b>24</b>, a rotatable shaft <b>100</b>B associated with the packer unit <b>18</b>, a rotatable shaft <b>100</b>C associated with the pickup unit <b>12</b> (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>), or a rotatable shaft <b>100</b>E driven by the crop flow/bale/crop material (such as a shaft associated with a star wheel in the bottom of the main bale chamber <b>26</b>). The baler <b>10</b> can also include other types of rotatable shafts that rotate on a continuous or intermittent basis, and used to drive the APS <b>52</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\">When configured as a rotatable shaft <b>100</b>, the APS <b>52</b> can include a rotatable power generation device <b>54</b> in the form of a hydraulic motor and/or electric motor which is used to generate power which is then stored in the power storage device <b>56</b>. When the power generation device <b>54</b> is a hydraulic motor then the power storage device can be configured as one or more hydraulic accumulators. When the power generation device <b>54</b> is an electric motor then the power storage device <b>56</b> can be configured as one or more ultracapacitors and/or batteries.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref>, the movable component <b>100</b> is assumed to be a linearly moving component <b>100</b>D on the baler <b>10</b>, such as the plunger <b>30</b> which reciprocates within the main bale chamber <b>26</b>, as indicated by direction arrow <b>104</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\">When configured as a linearly movable component <b>100</b>, the APS <b>52</b> can include a linearly movable power generation device <b>54</b> in the form of a hydraulic cylinder assembly <b>106</b> with a piston <b>108</b> which reciprocates within a two-way cylinder <b>110</b>. Pressurized fluid flows through a fluid line <b>112</b> to the hydraulic accumulator <b>62</b>. A check valve <b>114</b> prevents the pressurized fluid from flowing back into the cylinder assembly <b>106</b> on the return stroke of the piston <b>108</b>. The pressurized hydraulic fluid that is stored in the accumulator <b>62</b> can be used for various purposes, such as transferring power via a line <b>116</b> back to the driveline <b>50</b> using a motor <b>58</b>, or powering auxiliary components such as lights, fans, motors, etc via a line <b>118</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\">The movable component <b>100</b> can also move in both a rotational and translational manner, such as the crank arm <b>40</b> which drives the plunger <b>30</b>. The APS <b>52</b> can be configured to harvest the rotational and/or the translational (i.e., linear) movement of the crank arm <b>40</b> so that power can be generated and stored.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\">During operation of the baler <b>10</b>, the driveline <b>50</b> drives the gearbox <b>42</b>, which in turn drives the plunger <b>30</b> using the crank arm <b>40</b>. The plunger <b>30</b> reciprocates back and forth during compression cycles within the main bale chamber <b>26</b>. The driveline <b>50</b> also directly or indirectly drives other movable components <b>100</b> onboard the baler <b>10</b>. The APS <b>52</b> can be coupled with and driven by one or more selected movable components <b>100</b>, which can either be rotationally or linearly movable components, as described above. Power from the movable component <b>100</b> is used to drive a power generation device <b>54</b> such as a hydraulic pump, electric motor and/or hydraulic cylinder. The power can be harvested at any time during the movement of the movable component <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, the power is harvested during off-peak load periods of the plunger <b>30</b> and timed in coordination with the duty cycle of the plunger <b>30</b>, as described above with reference to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 3-5</figref>. After the hydraulic and/or electric power is stored in an appropriately configured power storage device <b>56</b>, the power can then be subsequently used for various purposes onboard the baler <b>10</b>. For example, a power feedback device <b>58</b> can be used to transfer power back to the driveline <b>50</b> to flatten out the power requirements of the baler <b>10</b>, or the power can be used to power auxiliary components such as lights, fans, motors, etc.</p>\n",

In an embodiment, data representing historical planting dates, relative maturity values, and crop yield is received by an agricultural intelligence computer system. Based on the historical data, the system generates spatial and temporal maps of planting dates, relative maturity, and actual production history. Using the maps, the system creates a model of potential yield that is dependent on planting date and relative maturity. The system may then receive actual production history data for a particular field. Using the received actual production history data, a particular planting date, and a particular relative maturity value, the agricultural intelligence computer system computes a potential yield for a particular field.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">The present disclosure relates to digital computer modeling of potential crop yield based on planting dates and relative maturity values. Additionally, the present disclosure relates to generation of notifications, recommendations, and graphical user interfaces based on digital models of potential yield.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0003\" level=\"1\">BACKGROUND</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">The approaches described in this section are approaches that could be pursued, but not necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated, it should not be assumed that any of the approaches described in this section qualify as prior art merely by virtue of their inclusion in this section.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">Farmers often must make planting decisions regarding one or more fields based on incomplete information. Specifically, before planting a crop, a farmer must determine when to plant the crop to achieve maximum crop yield. While the general planting season for a particular type of crop may be generally known, due to various temperature and weather related factors, the actual yield of a crop may vary based on the day within the planting season when the crop is planted.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">An additional decision a farmer must make involves the type of seed hybrid planted. Crops, such as corn, generally have multiple types of hybrid, each of which may produce a different yield of corn. While the type of hybrid effects the total yield of the crop, the effect of selecting one seed over another changes with respect to planting date and location. For example, for a particular planting day in a first location, a first seed type may produce a higher yield than a second seed type, while for the same planting day in a second location, the second seed type may produce a higher yield than the first seed type.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">Given the dependence of total crop yield the type of seed planted, the date the seed is planted, and the location of the field, objective data identifying the best planting date and seed type is generally unavailable. As the type of seed planted and the date of planting may have a strong impact on the total yield of the farm, and thus on the total profits of the farmer, it would be beneficial to provide a farmer with data indicating the best planting dates and seed selections for the farmer's particular field.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0060\">When field data <b>106</b> is not provided directly to the agricultural intelligence computer system via one or more agricultural machines or agricultural machine devices that interacts with the agricultural intelligence computer system, the user may be prompted via one or more user interfaces on the user device (served by the agricultural intelligence computer system) to input such information. In an example embodiment, the user may specify identification data by accessing a map on the user device (served by the agricultural intelligence computer system) and selecting specific CLUs that have been graphically shown on the map. In an alternative embodiment, the user <b>102</b> may specify identification data by accessing a map on the user device (served by the agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b>) and drawing boundaries of the field over the map. Such CLU selection or map drawings represent geographic identifiers.

      "<p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0062\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> depicts an example embodiment of a timeline view for data entry. Using the display depicted in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, a user computer can input a selection of a particular field and a particular date for the addition of event. Events depicted at the top of the timeline include Nitrogen, Planting, Practices, and Soil. To add a nitrogen application event, a user computer may provide input to select the nitrogen tab. The user computer may then select a location on the timeline for a particular field in order to indicate an application of nitrogen on the selected field. In response to receiving a selection of a location on the timeline for a particular field, the data manager may display a data entry overlay, allowing the user computer to input data pertaining to nitrogen applications, planting procedures, soil application, tillage procedures, irrigation practices, or other information relating to the particular field. For example, if a user computer selects a portion of the timeline and indicates an application of nitrogen, then the data entry overlay may include fields for inputting an amount of nitrogen applied, a date of application, a type of fertilizer used, and any other information related to the application of nitrogen.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0063\">In an embodiment, the data manager provides an interface for creating one or more programs. &#x201c;Program,&#x201d; in this context, refers to a set of data pertaining to nitrogen applications, planting procedures, soil application, tillage procedures, irrigation practices, or other information that may be related to one or more fields, and that can be stored in digital data storage for reuse as a set in other operations. After a program has been created, it may be conceptually applied to one or more fields and references to the program may be stored in digital storage in association with data identifying the fields. Thus, instead of manually entering identical data relating to the same nitrogen applications for multiple different fields, a user computer may create a program that indicates a particular application of nitrogen and then apply the program to multiple different fields. For example, in the timeline view of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, the top two timelines have the &#x201c;Fall applied&#x201d; program selected, which includes an application of 150 lbs N/ac in early April. The data manager may provide an interface for editing a program. In an embodiment, when a particular program is edited, each field that has selected the particular program is edited. For example, in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, if the &#x201c;Fall applied&#x201d; program is edited to reduce the application of nitrogen to 130 lbs N/ac, the top two fields may be updated with a reduced application of nitrogen based on the edited program.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0064\">In an embodiment, in response to receiving edits to a field that has a program selected, the data manager removes the correspondence of the field to the selected program. For example, if a nitrogen application is added to the top field in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, the interface may update to indicate that the &#x201c;Fall applied&#x201d; program is no longer being applied to the top field. While the nitrogen application in early April may remain, updates to the &#x201c;Fall applied&#x201d; program would not alter the April application of nitrogen.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0065\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> depicts an example embodiment of a spreadsheet view for data entry.

The data manager may include spreadsheets for inputting information with respect to Nitrogen, Planting, Practices, and Soil as depicted in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>. To edit a particular entry, a user computer may select the particular entry in the spreadsheet and update the values. For example, <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> depicts an in-progress update to a target yield value for the second field. Additionally, a user computer may select one or more fields in order to apply one or more programs. In response to receiving a selection of a program for a particular field, the data manager may automatically complete the entries for the particular field based on the selected program. As with the timeline view, the data manager may update the entries for each field associated with a particular program in response to receiving an update to the program. Additionally, the data manager may remove the correspondence of the selected program to the field in response to receiving an edit to one of the entries for the field.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0066\">In an embodiment, model and field data is stored in model and field data repository <b>160</b>. Model data comprises data models created for one or more fields.

In one embodiment, nitrogen instructions <b>210</b> are programmed to provide tools to inform nitrogen decisions by visualizing the availability of nitrogen to crops. This enables growers to maximize yield or return on investment through optimized nitrogen application during the season. Example programmed functions include displaying images such as SSURGO images to enable drawing of application zones and/or images generated from subfield soil data, such as data obtained from sensors, at a high spatial resolution (as fine as 10 meters or smaller because of their proximity to the soil); upload of existing grower-defined zones; providing an application graph and/or a map to enable tuning application(s) of nitrogen across multiple zones; output of scripts to drive machinery; tools for mass data entry and adjustment; and/or maps for data visualization, among others. &#x201c;Mass data entry,&#x201d; in this context, may mean entering data once and then applying the same data to multiple fields that have been defined in the system; example data may include nitrogen application data that is the same for many fields of the same grower, but such mass data entry applies to the entry of any type of field data into the mobile computer application <b>200</b>. For example, nitrogen instructions <b>210</b> may be programmed to accept definitions of nitrogen planting and practices programs and to accept user input specifying to apply those programs across multiple fields. &#x201c;Nitrogen planting programs,&#x201d; in this context, refers to a stored, named set of data that associates: a name, color code or other identifier, one or more dates of application, types of material or product for each of the dates and amounts, method of application or incorporation such as injected or knifed in, and/or amounts or rates of application for each of the dates, crop or hybrid that is the subject of the application, among others. &#x201c;Nitrogen practices programs,&#x201d; in this context, refers to a stored, named set of data that associates: a practices name; a previous crop; a tillage system; a date of primarily tillage; one or more previous tillage systems that were used; one or more indicators of application type, such as manure, that were used. Nitrogen instructions <b>210</b> also may be programmed to generate and cause displaying a nitrogen graph, which indicates projections of plant use of the specified nitrogen and whether a surplus or shortfall is predicted; in some embodiments, different color indicators may signal a magnitude of surplus or magnitude of shortfall. In one embodiment, a nitrogen graph comprises a graphical display in a computer display device comprising a plurality of rows, each row associated with and identifying a field; data specifying what crop is planted in the field, the field size, the field location, and a graphic representation of the field perimeter; in each row, a timeline by month with graphic indicators specifying each nitrogen application and amount at points correlated to month names; and numeric and/or colored indicators of surplus or shortfall, in which color indicates magnitude.</p>\n",

Agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may also receive data identifying average production values for a plurality of counties. As the average production values cannot be correlated to planting dates at a finer granularity than the county level, agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may create average values of planting dates for the county to correlate to the actual production values. Thus, agricultural intelligence computer system may compute an average planting date for the county by averaging the planting dates for each field within the county or a random sample of fields within the county. In an embodiment, fields within a county are weighted based on an estimated impact on the average planting date for the county. For example, if a first field is twice as large as a second field, agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may give the first field twice the weight as the second field when averaging planting dates. Thus, if the first field was planted on the first of the month and the second field was planted on the thirtieth of the month, agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may compute the weighted average of the planting date of the two fields as the tenth of the month.

The relative planting date may comprise the difference between the raw median planting date and a reference planting date. The reference planting date may be an aggregated median planting date for the year across a plurality of locations, an aggregated median planting date for a particular location across a plurality of years, and/or an aggregated median planting date across a plurality of locations and a plurality of years.

The predictor variables in X<sub>c,t </sub>may include a planting date variable and a relative maturity variable.

The crop stress indices, as described further herein, represent conditions that negatively affect the optimal yield of a crop. As the effects of each crop stress index may vary from location to location, the set of coefficients corresponding to the crop stress indices, &#x3b3;<sub>c</sub>, may be parameterized separately for each location or with one or more location dependent terms. For example, if the crop stress index representing day heat stress has a large impact on the crop yields at a first location than at a second location, the corresponding coefficient for the first location may be higher than the corresponding coefficient for the second location. As the differences between the effects of crop stress indices do not vary heavily between some locations, in an embodiment &#x3b3;<sub>c </sub>is assumed to be normally distributed for each coefficient value with a mean of &#x3b3;<sub>0 </sub>and variance of &#x3c3;<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>.</p>\n",

Agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may model the potential crop yield as a latent function of the observed total yield using past crop stress data and past yield values for a particular location. For example, agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may receive data identifying, for a particular location and year, temperature measurements, precipitation measurements, watering practices, nutrient applications, and soil data. Based on the received data, agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may model the effects of various crop stress indices on the total yield of a crop. Based on the modeled effects of crop stress and the total yield, agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may determine potential crop yields for each location and year.

For example, each modeling parameter may be fitted under a Bayesian framework such that a distribution is generated for each modeling parameter instead of point estimates. By basing the model of actual yield on probabilistic estimates of modeling parameters, such as relative maturity and planting dates, a model is created which better estimates uncertainty in actual yield and allows for smarter decision making with respect to risk tolerance.</p>\n",

Each type of crop stress index described is a digitally stored value that is calculated by computer using observed agricultural data over a specified period. In an embodiment, the specified period used to calculate a crop stress index may be derived from a crop's lifecycle called the crop phenology.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0132\" num=\"0148\">The lifecycle of corn plants is measured using growth development stages starting from seeding to physiological maturity, also known as black layer. <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an example embodiment of corn growth stages. Corn growth stages are divided into two major types of stages, vegetative and reproductive stages. Vegetative growth stages are the stages where the corn plant develops from a seed to a fully formed plant. The vegetative growth stages are characterized by the crop increasing in biomass, developing roots, stalk, and leaves, and preparing itself for reproduction. Vegetative growth stages begin with the corn emergence stage, labelled as &#x201c;VE&#x201d;, and end with the fully visible tassel stage, &#x201c;VT&#x201d;. Corn emergence (VE) signifies the first visible site of the corn plant from the ground. Fully visible tassel (VT) signifies the stage where the tassels, pollen producing flowers, are completely visible. Between the VE and VT stages exist multiple vegetative stages that describe the growth of the corn plant by how many uppermost leaves are visible with the leaf collar. For example, &#x201c;V2&#x201d; signifies the growth stage where two leaves are fully expanded with the leaf collar visible, and &#x201c;V12&#x201d; signifies the growth stage where twelve leaves are fully expanded with the leaf collar visible.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0133\" num=\"0149\">The reproductive stages describe stages from when pollen may occur to the corn plant's physical maturity. The reproductive stages begin at silking stage &#x201c;R1&#x201d; and end at the physiological maturity stage &#x201c;R6&#x201d;, also known as the black layer stage. Between stages R1 and R6 are stages describing the corn plant's growth. For example, &#x201c;R2&#x201d; is called the blister stage where kernels are described as being white and resemble a blister in shape. Stage &#x201c;R3&#x201d; is called the milk stage, where kernels are yellow on the outside with milky inner fluid. Stage &#x201c;R4&#x201d; is called the dough stage, where the milky inner fluid thickens to a pasty consistency. Stage &#x201c;R5&#x201d; is called the dent stage, where the kernels show a physical dent.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0134\" num=\"0150\">The phenology stages of the corn plant may be tracked based upon factors outside the appearance of the individual corn plants. For example, the phenological development of corn plants is strongly related to the accumulation of heat by the corn plants, which furthers corn plant growth. The accumulation of heat may be measured by daily maximum and minimum temperatures. In an embodiment, growing degree days (GDD) are used to track the different developmental stages of corn plant growth. GDD may be calculated using different observational data and different thresholds. For example, GDD may be calculated as:</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0141\" num=\"0153\">Flooding of fields can be extremely detrimental to the growth of corn crop. For example, standing water may become ponded on top of corn plants causing them to suffer from overwatering and a depletion of oxygen content in the soil. Lack of oxygen in soil may inhibit plants from performing functions such as nutrient and water uptake which will negatively affect the overall crop yield. A flood stress index may be used to quantify the negative effects of observed flooding in order to more accurately predict crop yields. In an embodiment, flood stress is calculated as the sum of the daily water runoff that is above a particular threshold of runoff water. Runoff refers to water not absorbed by the soil that flows above the soil. When measuring runoff, some runoff may be a result of water not being absorbed as fast as the scheduled watering session delivers the water. Therefore only runoff that is above an allowable threshold is considered to be contributing to flood. For example, if the allowable threshold of runoff for a field is configured as 3.75 inches, then any measured runoff above 3.75 inches counts toward the total amount of runoff for calculating flood stress. In an embodiment, stage one flood stress may be calculated as the sum of daily runoff that is above 3.75 over a period from seeding to V8, where stage one covers seeding through V8. In other embodiments, the threshold may be adjusted based upon the soil composition and water absorption rate of the soil.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0143\" num=\"0155\">Inadequate soil moisture during growth periods can result in reduced corn yield because nutrient availability, uptake, and transport are impaired without sufficient water in the soil. A drought stress index may be used to quantify the level of inadequate soil moisture over various stages of crop growth. In an embodiment, drought stress is calculated as the sum of daily soil moisture records that are below a specified drought threshold. For example, if the specific drought threshold is 20% then all daily soil moisture records that fall below 20% are summed together over the measured growth stages to make up the drought stress crop stress index. In an embodiment, stage one drought stress is calculated as the sum of all daily soil moisture records between growth stages V8 and V16 where the soil moisture value is below the 20% drought threshold. In other embodiments, drought stress may be calculated as stage two and stage three drought stress, where stage two covers growth stages from R1 through R2, and stage three covers growth stages from R3 through R5.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0145\" num=\"0157\">As discussed, inadequate soil moisture during growth periods can result in reduced corn yield, particularly in the early growth stages. In an embodiment, early drought stress may be measured as the sum of the amount of precipitation minus runoff when daily precipitation minus runoff is between zero and 2.5 inches. Precipitation minus runoff equals the amount of water that is absorbed into the soil. By only quantifying water absorbed into the soil when it is below 2.5 inches the early drought stress quantifies when only little water is absorbed. In an embodiment, early drought stress covers the range from planting to V6.</p>\n",

If none of the daily maximum temperatures exceed 93 degrees Fahrenheit, then the daytime heat stress during this period would be zero. If however, the daily maximum temperature between growth stages V10 and V16 exceeded 93 degrees twice, both being 100 degrees, then the daytime heat stress would be the sum of (100&#x2212;93) for both days equaling a total heat stress of 14 for this period.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0151\" num=\"0163\">High nighttime temperatures can be extremely detrimental to the growth of corn crop. High nighttime temperatures may cause corn plants to metabolize sugars at a high rate through the night. This may result in the plant over-consuming sugars for the growth period instead of allotting sugar for the production of kernels. High plant metabolism at night can result in diminished yield because the plant does not have enough resources to produce healthy kernels during the reproduction stage. Nighttime heat stress may be calculated as the sum of number of degrees Fahrenheit for each night above a defined threshold. For example, agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may calculate the nighttime heat stress as the sum of the daily minimum temperatures that are above a minimum temperature threshold of 70 degrees Fahrenheit. In an embodiment, the crop stress index calculation instructions <b>138</b> provide instruction to calculate a stage one nighttime heat stress, where stage one covers R1 through R5 and the minimum threshold temperature is 70 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0152\" num=\"0164\">3.5.7 Nutrient Stress</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0153\" num=\"0165\">Lack of one or more nutrients may affect the potential yield of a crop. For example, nitrogen stress describes the effect of a crop's inability to receive an optimal amount of nitrogen on the growth of the crop. Each crop has a different optimal amount of nitrogen which defines a minimum amount of nitrogen below which the growth of the crop is adversely affected. Optimal amounts of nitrogen may change throughout the development cycle of the crop. Nutrient stress may be computed as a difference between a modeled or measured amount of the nutrient in the soil and a value representing the minimum amount of the nutrient that a crop may access below which the growth of the crop is adversely affected. Nutrient stress may also be computed as a number of days in which the crop is unable to meet its need for one or more nutrients. Thus, if nitrate levels in the soil fall below a threshold minimum value for five days, agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may identify a yield response for five days of nitrogen stress.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0155\" num=\"0167\">In an embodiment, agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> is programmed to use trial data at one or more locations to strengthen the models of potential yield and total yield. Agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may initially receive trial planting data identifying one or more planting dates, relative maturity values, and yields for a plurality of trial fields. Agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may also receive trial weather data identifying one or more observed weather events at the plurality of trial fields. From the planting dates, relative maturity values, and weather data, agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may compute an estimated yield of crops on the plurality fields. Agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may compare the estimated yield of the crops with the actual yield of the crops to determine if the model properly captures the effects of planting dates and relative maturity values on the total yield of the crop. Agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may use the results of the comparison to update the models. For example, if modeled yield values associated with a particular relative maturity value tend to be low when compared to actual yield values, agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may update the coefficients associated with the predictor variables of relative maturity to increase the effect of the particular relative maturity value on the yield.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0156\" num=\"0168\">In an embodiment, the trial data comprises trials where one or more factors are kept constant. Agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may be programmed to use the trial data with one or more factors that are kept constant to strengthen the estimation of potential yield with respect to the relative maturity, planting date, and location. For example, one set of trials may include a plurality of locations where a single crop is planted on a particular date. As the planting date and relative maturity do not change, agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may determine an effect of location on the potential yield. A second set of trials may include a plurality of locations with different crops planted on the same planting date. Using this data, agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may identify a location dependent effect of relative maturity on the potential yield and a general effect of relative maturity on the potential yield. Similar trials may be performed with different planting dates at a particular location or at various location using particular seed types. Based on the results of the described trials, agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may update the model of potential yield to better fit the trial data. For example, if the trial data indicates a high variation of yield based on relative maturity data which is underrepresented in the model of potential yield, agricultural intelligence computer system <b>130</b> may update the coefficients associated with the predictor variables of relative maturity to increase the effect of relative maturity values on the yield.</p>\n",
